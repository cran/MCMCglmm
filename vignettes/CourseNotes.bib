  abstract	= {Multivariate models are of great importance in theoretical
		  and applied quantitative genetics. We extend quantitative
		  genetic theory to accommodate situations in which there is
		  linear feedback or recursiveness between the phenotypes
		  involved in a multivariate system, assuming an
		  infinitesimal, additive, model of inheritance. It is shown
		  that structural parameters defining a simultaneous or
		  recursive system have a bearing on the interpretation of
		  quantitative genetic parameter estimates (e.g.,
		  heritability, offspring-parent regression, genetic
		  correlation) when such features are ignored. Matrix
		  representations are given for treating a plethora of
		  feedback- recursive situations. The likelihood function is
		  derived, assuming multivariate normality, and results from
		  econometric theory for parameter identification are adapted
		  to a quantitative genetic setting. A Bayesian treatment
		  with a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation is suggested
		  for inference and developed. When the system is fully
		  recursive, all conditional posterior distributions are in
		  closed form, so Gibbs sampling is straightforward. If there
		  is feedback, a Metropolis step may be embedded for sampling
		  the structural parameters, since their conditional
		  distributions are unknown. Extensions of the model to
		  discrete random variables and to nonlinear relationships

  pages		= {549-557},
  abstract	= {Evolutionary theory is primarily concerned with genetic
		  processes, yet empirical testing of this theory often
		  involves data collected on phenotypes. To make this
		  tenable, the implicit assumption is often made that
		  phenotypic patterns are good predictors of genetic
		  patterns; an assumption that coined the phenotypic gambit.
		  Although this assumption has been validated for traits with
		  high heritability, such as morphology, its generality for
		  traits with low heritabilities, such as life-history and
		  behavioural traits, remains controversial. Using a
		  large-scale cross-fostering experiment, we were able to
		  measure genetic, common environmental and phenotypic
		  correlations between four colour traits and two skeletal
		  traits in a wild population of passerine birds, the blue
		  tit (Parus caeruleus). Colour traits had little heritable
		  variation but common environment effects were found to be
		  important; skeletal traits showed the opposite pattern.
		  Positive correlations because of a shared natal environment
		  were found between all traits, obscuring negative genetic
		  correlations between some colour and skeletal traits.
		  Consequently, phenotypic patterns were poor surrogates for
		  genetic patterns and we suggest that this may be common if
		  trade-offs or substantial parental effects exist. For this
		  group of traits, the phenotypic gambit cannot be made and
		  we suggest caution when inferring genetic patterns from
		  phenotypic data, especially for behavioural and
		  life-history traits.},

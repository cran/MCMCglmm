  title		= {Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models},
  journal	= {Journal of the American Statistical Association},
  volume	= {88},

  pages		= {9-25},
  abstract	= {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated
		  errors, shrinkage estimation, and smoothing of regression
		  relationships may be encompassed within the framework of
		  the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Given an
		  unobserved vector of random effects, observations are
		  assumed to be conditionally independent with means that
		  depend on the linear predictor through a specified link
		  function and conditional variances that are specified by a
		  variance function, known prior weights and a scale factor.
		  The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed
		  with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown
		  variance components. For problems involving time series,
		  spatial aggregation and smoothing, the dispersion may be
		  specified in terms of a rank deficient inverse covariance
		  matrix. Approximation of the marginal quasi-likelihood
		  using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating
		  equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the
		  mean parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances.
		  Implementation involves repeated calls to normal theory
		  procedures for REML estimation in variance components
		  problems. By means of informal mathematical arguments,
		  simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude
		  that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on
		  parameters and realizations of random effects in the
		  hierarchical model. The applications cover overdispersion
		  in binomial proportions of seed germination: longitudinal
		  analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients; smoothing of
		  birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast
		  cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort
		  effects in a case-control study of childhood cancer and
		  obstetric radiation; spatial aggregation of lip cancer
		  rates in Scottish counties; and the success of salamander
		  matings in a complicated experiment involving crossing of
		  male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate
		  somewhat the variance components and (in absolute value)
		  fixed effects when applied to clustered binary data, but
		  the situation improves rapidly for binomial observations
		  having denominators greater than one.},

  journal	= {Journal of Evolutionary Biology},

  pages		= {549-557},
  abstract	= {Evolutionary theory is primarily concerned with genetic
		  processes, yet empirical testing of this theory often
		  involves data collected on phenotypes. To make this
		  tenable, the implicit assumption is often made that
		  phenotypic patterns are good predictors of genetic
		  patterns; an assumption that coined the phenotypic gambit.
		  Although this assumption has been validated for traits with
		  high heritability, such as morphology, its generality for
		  traits with low heritabilities, such as life-history and
		  behavioural traits, remains controversial. Using a
		  large-scale cross-fostering experiment, we were able to
		  measure genetic, common environmental and phenotypic
		  correlations between four colour traits and two skeletal
		  traits in a wild population of passerine birds, the blue
		  tit (Parus caeruleus). Colour traits had little heritable
		  variation but common environment effects were found to be
		  important; skeletal traits showed the opposite pattern.
		  Positive correlations because of a shared natal environment
		  were found between all traits, obscuring negative genetic
		  correlations between some colour and skeletal traits.
		  Consequently, phenotypic patterns were poor surrogates for
		  genetic patterns and we suggest that this may be common if
		  trade-offs or substantial parental effects exist. For this
		  group of traits, the phenotypic gambit cannot be made and
		  we suggest caution when inferring genetic patterns from
		  phenotypic data, especially for behavioural and
		  life-history traits.},

  abstract	= {Linear mixed models are able to handle an extraordinary
		  range of complications in regression-type analyses. Their
		  most common use is to account for within-subject
		  correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also
		  the standard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data.
		  However, when treated in full generality, mixed models can
		  also handle spline-type smoothing and closely approximate
		  kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models
		  (e.g., additive models and varying coefficient models) to
		  be handled within the mixed model framework. The key is to
		  allow the random effects design matrix to have general
		  structure; hence our label general design. For continuous
		  response data, particularly when Gaussianity of the
		  response is reasonably assumed, computation is now quite
		  mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS packages.
		  Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where
		  generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but
		  are hindered by the presence of intractable multivariate
		  integrals. Software known to us supports special cases of
		  the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or g1mmML in R) or
		  relies on the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of
		  integrals (e.g., the SAS macro glimmix or g1mmPQL in R).
		  This paper describes the fitting of general design
		  generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is
		  taken and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for
		  estimation and inference. In this generalized setting, MCMC
		  requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In this
		  article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS
		  facilitates sound fitting of general design Bayesian
		  generalized linear mixed models in practice.},

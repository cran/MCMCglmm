   Abstract = {A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches (Fringillidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks(1-6). Thus, ground finches have deep and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks ( low depth and narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks, reflecting differences in their respective diets(6). Previous work has shown that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions ( depth, width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall fitness of the birds(3-7). Recently we used a candidate gene approach to explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis(8). However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes. More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.},

   Abstract = {Paternity analysis can be used to estimate mean effective pollen dispersal (mu(d)) by sampling offspring from a mother plant and assaying each for a large number of allozyme loci. The male in the population with the highest likelihood of paternity, based entirely on the degree of genetic relationship with the offspring (transition probability) or combined with information on probability of mating with the mother plant, is inferred as the pollen parent. Computer simulations show that the mean distance between inferred males and mother plants (dBAR) reliably estimateS mu(d) in defined circumstances. If male mating success decreases with distance from the mother plant, paternity inference based entirely on transition probabilities results in dBAR values that are upwardly biased, perhaps considerably. More reliable estimates can be obtained in this situation when prior information on the general form of the relationship between mating success and distance between mates (the distance function) is used, along with transition probabilities, to infer paternity. However, this procedure is valid only when the general form of the distance function can be reliably assumed. Computer simulations also show that the bootstrap method can be used to closely approximate the SE of dBAR.},

While the use of metaanalysis is widespread in medicine and the social sciences, only recently has it been applied to ecological questions. We compared the results of parametric confidence limits and homogeneity statistics commonly obtained through meta-analysis to those obtained from resampling methods to ascertain the robustness of standard meta-analytic techniques. We found that confidence limits based on bootstrapping methods were wider than standard confidence limits, implying that resampling estimates are more conservative. In addition, we found that significance tests based on homogeneity statistics differed occasionally from results of randomization tests, implying that inferences based solely on chi-square significance tests may lead to erroneous conclusions. We conclude that resampling methods should be incorporated in meta-analysis studies, to ensure proper evaluation of main effects in ecological studies.},

Our approach uses residual randomization from a generalized linear model, and allows the statistical comparison of sympatric phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric character divergence when they are present, and does not identify such patterns when they are not. Our analytical approach complements and extends the suggestions of Goldberg and Lande (2006), by allowing a full statistical assessment of the varied patterns of character displacement along environmental gradients, or while accounting for other covariates and sources of variation.},

   Abstract = {Meta-analysis is a powerful statistical technique that combines the results of independent studies to identify general trends. When the species under examination are not independent however, it is also necessary to incorporate phylogenetic information into the analysis. Unfortunately, current meta-analytic approaches cannot account for lack of independence resulting from shared evolutionary history, so a general solution to this problem is lacking. In this article, I derive a model for phylogenetic meta-analysis, so that data across studies may be summarized with evolutionary history explicitly incorporated. The approach takes advantage of common aspects of linear statistical models used by both meta-analysis and the phylogenetic comparative method, thereby allowing them to be analytically combined. In this manner, the correlation structure generated by phylogenetic history can be incorporated directly into the meta-analytic procedure. I illustrate the approach by examining the prevalence of body size clines in mammals. The approach is general, and can also be used to incorporate correlation structure among studies generated by other factors, such as spatial or temporal proximity, or environmental similarity. Therefore, this procedure provides a general statistical template for meta-analytic techniques that can account for attributes that generate nonindependence among studies. Implications of the phylogenetic meta-analysis are discussed.},

In this study, we measured 96,996 adult Plethodon from 3974 populations to test for the presence of Bergmann's clines in these salamanders. Only three Plethodon species exhibited a significant negative correlation between body size and temperature consistent with Bergmann's rule, whereas 37 of 40 species did not display a pattern consistent with this prediction. Further, a phylogenetic comparative analysis found no relationship between body size and temperature among species. A meta-analysis combining our data with the available data for other amphibian species revealed no support for Bergmann's rule at the genus (Plethodon), order (Caudata), or class (Amphibia) levels. Our findings strongly suggest that negative thermal body size clines are not common in amphibians, and we conclude that Bergmann's rule is not generally applicable to these taxa. Thus, evolutionary explanations of Bergmann's clines in other tetrapods need not account for unique life-history attributes of amphibians.},

Quantitative genetic approaches to understanding multivariate selection and genetic response to selection have proven to be powerful tools in this endeavor, particularly with respect to short-term evolution. However, the application of quantitative genetic theory over periods of substantial phenotypic change is controversial because it requires that the requisite genetic parameters remain constant over the period of time in question. We show herein how attempts to determine the stability of key genetic parameters may be misled by the 'many genes of small effect' type of genetic architecture generally assumed in quantitative genetics. The presence of genes of major effect (GOMEs) can alter the genetic variance-covariance matrix dramatically for brief periods of time, significantly alter the rate and trajectory of multivariate evolution, and thereby mislead attempts to reconstruct or predict long term evolution.},

   Abstract = {Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when the phenotype of an individual, and possibly its fitness, depends, at least in part, on the genes of its social partners. The effective result is that environmental sources of phenotypic variance can themselves evolve. Simple models have shown that IGEs can alter the rate and direction of evolution for traits involved in interactions. Here we expand the applicability of the theory of IGEs to evolution in metapopulations by including nonlinear interactions between individuals and population genetic structure. Although population subdivision alone generates some dramatic and nonintuitive evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, the combination of nonlinear interactions with subdivision reveals an even greater importance of IGEs. The presence of genetic structure links the evolution of interacting phenotypes and the traits that influence their expression ("effector traits") even in the absence of genetic correlations. When nonlinear social effects occur in subdivided populations, evolutionary response is altered and can even oppose the direction expected due to direct selection. Because population genetic structure allows for multilevel selection, we also investigate the role of IGEs in determining the response to individual and group selection. We find that nonlinear social effects can cause interference between levels of selection even when they act in the same direction. In some cases, interference can be so extreme that the actual evolutionary response to multilevel selection is opposite in direction to that predicted by summing selection at each level. This theoretical result confirms empirical data that show higher levels of selection cannot be ignored even when selection acts in the same direction at all levels.},

   Abstract = {In many applications observations have some type of clustering, with observations within clusters tending to be correlated. A common instance of this occurs when each subject in the sample undergoes repeated measurement, in which case a cluster consists of the set of observations for the subject. One approach to modeling clustered data introduces cluster-level random effects into the model. The use of random effects in linear models for normal responses is well established. By contrast, random effects have only recently seen much use in models for categorical data. This chapter surveys a variety of potential social science applications of random effects modeling of categorical data. Applications discussed include repeated measurement for binary or ordinal responses, shrinkage to improve multiparameter estimation of a set of proportions or rates, multivariate latent variable modeling, hierarchically structured modeling, and cluster sampling. The models discussed belong to the class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), an extension of ordinary linear models that permits nonnormal response variables and both fixed and random effects in the predictor term. The models are GLMMs for either binomial or Poisson response variables, although we also present extensions to multicategory (nominal or ordinal) responses. We also summarize some of the technical issues of model-fitting that complicate the fitting of GLMMs even with existing software.},

   Abstract = {Currently favoured views for explaining ornaments in males emphasize female preference such that females benefit from increased offspring production, good genes of the offspring, or the attractiveness of sons. Results from long-term studies in the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca suggest that factors associated with species recognition may also be important for male coloration. In sympatry the collared flycatcher F. albicollis is dominant in competition for nesting sites over the pied flycatcher. Bright pied flycatcher males resemble collared flycatcher males and suffer from interspecific interference, whereas dull. and female-like males can acquire nesting sites close to those of the collared flycatcher. (A similar aggression release mechanism had previously been suggested to influence the evolution of colour differences in coral reef fishes.) Additionally, the risk of hybridization was low for the dullest pied flycatcher males, resurrecting the idea that avoiding mating with wrong species might currently be under selection. Thus interspecific effects related to species recognition can probably explain the dull plumage colour of pied flycatcher males in sympatry. In allopatry, intraspecific sexual selection for bright coloration in males seems to be weak, and even a low level of gene flow between sympatric and allopatric populations may maintain the high variation in this highly heritable trait.},

   Abstract = {The problem of inferring kinship structure among a sample of individuals using genetic markers is considered with the objective of developing hypothesis tests for genetic relatedness with nearly optimal properties. The class of tests considered are those that are constrained to be permutation invariant, which in this context defines tests whose properties do not depend oil the labeling of the individuals. This is appropriate when all individuals are to be treated identically from a statistical point of view. The approach taken is to derive tests that are provably most powerful for a permutation invariant alternative hypothesis that is, in some sense, close to a null hypothesis of mutual independence. This is analagous to the locally most powerful test commonly used in parametric inference. Although the resulting test statistic is a U- statistic, normal approximation theory is found to be inapplicable because of high skewness. As an alternative it is found that a conditional procedure based on the most powerful test statistic can calculate accurate significance levels without much loss in power. Examples are given in which this type of test proves to be more powerful than a number of alternatives considered in the literature, including Queller and Goodknight's (1989) estimate of genetic relatedness, the average number of shared alleles (Blouin, 1996), and the number of feasible sibling triples (Almudevar and Field, 1999).},

Surprisingly, however, the role of UV signaling on intrasexual selection has been neglected. In the present study, we aimed to test whether UV reflectance of crown feathers was used as a signal of male competitive ability during male-male interactions. Breeding male blue tits (Parus caffuleus ultramarinus) were exposed during the female egg-laying period to blue tit taxidermic mounts with either control or reduced UV reflectance of crown feathers. In agreement with the prediction that UV reflectance advertises male quality, we found that breeding blue tits behaved less aggressively toward the UV- reduced decoy. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence suggesting a role for LTV signaling on intrasexual selection.},

The proposed parallel algorithm retains the ability to explore multiple peaks in the posterior distribution of trees while maintaining a fast execution time.

Performance was no poorer when the surfaces surrounding the test surface were permuted, or when information from a potential comparison surface, the one with the highest luminance, was suppressed. Computer simulations of cone-photoreceptor activity showed that a reliable cue for making surface-colour matches in all experimental conditions was provided by the ratios of cone excitations between the test surfaces and a spatial average over the whole pattern.},

In outdoor aviaries placed in prime breeding habitat, males were allowed to choose between a colourful and a drab female. We found that males associated more with, and performed more sexual behaviours towards, colourful females. Female coloration was not age-related, but correlated significantly with body mass and tarsus length. Thus, we have demonstrated both a male preference for female ornamentation, and a relationship between ornament expression and female body size, which may be indicative of quality.

   Abstract = {Competition over mates takes many forms and has far-reaching consequences for many organisms. Recent work suggests that relative reproductive rates of males and females, sperm competition and quality variation among mates affect the strength of sexual selection. Song, other display, body size, visual ornaments and material resource offerings are often sexually selected. There is much empirical evidence of mate choice, and its evolution is clarified by mathematical models. Recent advances in theory also consider costs of choice, effects of deleterious mutations, fast and slow evolution of preferences and preferred traits, and simultaneous preferences for several traits. Contests over mates are important; so is sperm competition, scrambles, endurance rivalry, and coercion. The latter mechanisms have received less attention than mate choice. Sexual selection may explain puzzling aspects of plant pollination biology.},

   Abstract = {The ability of birds to perceive ultraviolet light (300-400 nm), to which humans are blind, has been neglected in avian behavioural ecology, and the occurrence and significance of ultraviolet (uv) colouration in plumage signals are important to explore. The support for a role of vv in avian communication comes mainly from demonstrations of uv-components in avian plumage reflectance, but most of these might be nonadaptive secondary effects of colouring mechanisms operating in longer wavelengths. Only colouration principally in the vv strongly suggests signalling in this spectral region. Here is presented the first example of nearly pure vv colouration in passerines, the Asian whistling thrushes (Myiophonus spp.). As in a previously investigated parrot species, the barb-born uv- structure seems to be a modification of the taxonomically widespread 'spongy structure' producing blue and violet feather colours. Lacking an obvious morphological constraint, the rarity of pure uv-signals is more likely to be explained by ambient light conditions and ecology. In the whistling- thrushes, a combination of high altitude, skylight-dominated habitat, mammalian predators, and semi-aquatic lifestyle might explain the evolution of vv-communication in this genus.},

We investigated UV colour vision in female social responses to the male UV/violet ornament in bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica. In an outdoor aviary at the breeding grounds, 16 females were each presented with a unique pair of males of equal age. In UVR (UV reduction) males, sunblock chemicals reduced only the UV reflectance and thereby the spectral shape (colour) of the throat ornament. In NR (neutral reduction) males, an achromatic pigment in the same base solvent (preen gland fat) was used for a corresponding but uniform brightness reduction. Both colour and brightness effects were invisible to human eyes, and were monitored by spectrometry. In 13 of the 16 trials, the female associated most with the NR male, a preference that implies that UV colour vision is used in mate choice by female bluethroats. Reflectance differences between one-year-old and older males were significant only in UV, suggestive of a UV colour cue in age-related mate preferences.},

Using molecular sex determination and UV/VIS spectrometry, we report here that blue tits are sexually dichromatic in UV/blue spectral purity (chroma) of the brilliant crown patch. It is displayed in courtship by horizontal Posturing and erected nape feathers. A previously undescribed sexual dimorphism in crown size (controlling for body size) further supports its role as an epigamic ornament. Against 'grey-brown' leaf litter and bark during pair formation in early spring, but also against green vegetation, UV contributes strongly to conspicuousness and sexual dimorphism. This should be further enhanced by the UV/bluish early morning skylight ('woodland shade') in which blue tits display Among 18 breeding pairs, there was strong assortative mating with respect to UV chroma, but not size, of the crown ornament. We conclude that blue tits are markedly sex dimorphic in their own visual world, and that UV/violet coloration probably plays a role in blue tit mate acquisition.},

   Abstract = {Many birds perceive, and some seem to communicate, in the W-A waveband (320-400 nm) invisible to humans, but the morphological mechanism and thereby scope for ultraviolet plumage signalling remain largely unstudied. No avian pigments or iridescence that reduce or enhance primarily UV reflectance are known, but a UV version of the common Tyndall "spongy structure" has been found in a parrot. A similar UV structure is here described for the first time in a passerine, the Blue Whistling-thrush Myiophonus caeruleus. Among patches of its plumage, and across other investigated species, a correlation between spongy structure dimensions and "hue" (spectral location of the reflectance peak) is consistent with current models of the optical mechanism, in particular the "hollow cylinder model" by Dyck (1971). Variations in "brightness" (intensity) and "chroma" (spectral purity) seem due mainly to modifications of ramus shape (flattening and a unique type of lateral flanges) and spongy layer thickness, here quantified by light paths laid out on the cross sections. The results suggest a wide potential for UV signals in passerines, but pure ("hidden") UV ornaments might be rare for other reasons. Keratin absorbance and declining ambient light in this spectral range: and perhaps also the 370 nm sensitivity maximum of the avian UV receptor, might constrain UV signals to the 400 nm region where they will be perceived as conspicuously violet also by humans. Finally, some possible "honesty-maintaining" ontogenetic costs of UV/violet plumage colours are discussed.},

Here we study reasons for this contradiction, analyzing signal function, signal content, and trade-offs between signals in the polygynous red-collared widowbird Euplectes ardens. Males have both a long, graduated tail and a red carotenoid collar badge. Territory-holding "residents" have slightly shorter tails than the nonbreeding "floaters," but their carotenoid collars are 40% larger, and they have (on the basis of reflectance spectrometry and objective colorimetry) a 23-nm more long-wave ("redder") hue than floaters. This corroborates experimental evidence that the red collar is selected by male contest competition, whereas female choice is based almost exclusively on male tail length. Tail length is negatively correlated with the carotenoid signal, which together with body size and condition explains 55% of the variation in tail length. The trade-off in tail length and carotenoid investment is steeper among residents, suggesting an interaction with costs of territory defense. We propose that the "multiple receiver hypothesis" can explain the coexistence of multiple handicap signals. Furthermore, the trade-off between signal expressions might contribute to the inverse relation between nuptial tail elongation and coloration in the genus Euplectes (bishops and widowbirds).},

We compared the G-matrices for meristic traits in two populations of garter snakes (Thanmnophis elegans) with an apparent separation time of 2 million years. Despite considerable divergence in the meristic traits, foraging habits, and diet, these populations show conservation of structure in their G- matrices. Using Flury's hierarchial approach to matrix comparisons, we found that the populations have retained the principal components (eigenvectors) of their G-matrices, but their eigenvalues have diverged. In contrast, we were unable to reject the hypothesis of equal environmental matrices (E- matrices) for these populations. We propose that a conserved pattern of multivariate stabilizing selection may have contributed to conservation of G- and E-matrix structure during the divergence of these populations.},

   Abstract = {Many studies have been aimed at understanding the maintenance of female infidelity in socially monogamous birds. Because engaging in extrapair copulations (EPCs) is believed to be costly for females, it has been argued that EPC behavior must bring indirect benefits to females by elevating offspring fitness. We use empirical data from the literature to assess the relative strength of indirect and direct selection on female EPC behavior, using quantitative genetic approximations of selection. This analysis confirmed that there is generally negative direct selection on EPC behavior caused by depressed paternal investment by social males. In contrast, there was no significant positive indirect selection on EPC behavior in females. A comparison between the two types of selection suggests that the force of direct negative selection is generally much stronger than that of indirect positive selection. Indirect selection is thus unlikely to maintain EPC behavior in the face of direct selection against it. We suggest that EPCs may instead be the result of antagonistic selection on loci influencing the outcome of male-female encounters and that EPC behavior per se may not be adaptive for females but may reflect sexual conflict due to strong selection in males to achieve extrapair copulations.},

We show that this model is exactly equivalent to a so-called Ising quantum chain. In this picture, fitness corresponds to the interaction energy of spins, and mutation to a temperature-like parameter. The highly elaborate methods of statistical mechanics allow one to find exact solutions for non-trivial examples. These include quadratic fitness functions, as well as 'Onsager's landscape'. The latter is a fitness function which captures some essential features of molecular evolution, such as neutrality, compensatory mutations and flat ridges. We investigate the mean number of mutations, the mutation load, and the variance in fitness under mutation-selection balance.

I used sexual dimorphism as an indirect measure of intensity of sexual selection and examined variation in sexual dimorphism in 126 extant species of cardueline finches. I controlled for phylogeny and potential confounding factors and tested the prediction that the extent of sexual dimorphism negatively covaries with elevation of breeding. As predicted, interspecific variation in sexual dimorphism was more strongly associated with changes in elevation than with habitat, nest dispersion and placement, and migratory status. Species occupying lower elevations were more sexually dimorphic in plumage than species at higher elevations. This variation was largely due to increased brightness of male plumage at lower elevations. I address possible explanations of this trend, which may include increased opportunities for extrapair fertilizations at lower elevations, an increase in the cost of secondary sexual trait production (i.e., molt) and maintenance at high elevations, and elevational variation in predation pressure.},

Examination of historical changes in carotenoid- versus melanin-based pigmentation in 126 extant species of Cardueline finches supported this prediction. We found that carotenoid- derived coloration changed more frequently among congeners than melanin-based coloration. In both sexes, increase in carotenoid-based coloration score, but not in melanin-based coloration score, was strongly associated with increase in sexual dichromatism. In addition, sexual dimorphism in carotenoid-based coloration contributed more to overall dichromatism than dimorphism in melanin-based plumage.

We found strong differences between sexes in direction of selection on sexually dimorphic traits, significant heritabilities of these traits, and a close congruence between current selection and observed sexual dimorphism in Montana house finches. Strong directional selection on sexually dimorphic traits and similar intensities of selection in each sex suggested that sexual dimorphism arises from adaptive responses in males and females, with both sexes being far from their local fitness optimum. This pattern is expected when a recently established population experiences continuous immigration from ecologically distinct areas of a species range or as a result of widely fluctuating selection pressures, as found in our study. Strong and sexually dimorphic selection pressures on heritable morphological traits, in combination with low phenotypic and genetic covariation among these traits during growth, may have accounted for close congruence between current selection and observed sexual dimorphism in the house inch. This conclusion is consistent with the profound adaptive population divergence in sexual dimorphism that accompanied very successful colonization of most of the North America by the house finch over the last 50 years.},

Frequent compensatory growth largely cancelled out the initial differences among nestlings, potentially enabling house finches to raise offspring under diverse and unpredictable environmental conditions.

We found that among-population morphological divergence in either males or females did not follow the within-population covariance patterns. Hierarchical patterns of similarity in morphological covariance matrices were not congruent with a priori defined historical pattern of population divergence. Both of these results point to the lack of proportionality in morphological covariance structure of finch populations, suggesting that random drift alone is unlikely to account for observed divergence. Furthermore, drift alone cannot explain the sex differences in within- and among-population covariance patterns or sex-specific patterns of evolution of covariance structure.

Here we examined whether this divergence was produced by population differences in local selection pressures acting on each sex. In a long-term study of recently established populations in Alabama, Michigan, and Montana, we examined three selection episodes for each sex: selection for pairing success, overwinter survival, and within-season fecundity. Populations varied in intensity of these selection episodes, the contribution of each episode to the net selection, and in the targets of selection. Direction and intensity of selection strongly differed between sexes, and different selection episodes often favored opposite changes in morphological traits. In each population, current net selection for sexual dimorphism was highly concordant with observed sexual dimorphism-in each population, selection for dimorphism was the strongest on the most dimorphic traits. Strong directional selection on sexually dimorphic traits, and similar intensities of selection in both sexes, suggest that in each of the recently established populations, both males and females are far from their local fitness optimum, and that sexual dimorphism has arisen from adaptive responses in both sexes. Population differences in patterns of selection on dimorphism, combined with both low levels of ontogenetic integration in heritable sexually dimorphic traits and sexual dimorphism in growth patterns, may account for the close correspondence between dimorphism in selection and observed dimorphism in morphology across house finch populations.},

   Abstract = {Life history responses to environmental conditions include a combination of fecundity-survival schedules and behavioral strategies that yield the highest fitness in a given environment. In this study, we examined the pattern of covariation in avian life history strategies along an elevational gradient by comparing variation in life history traits, including most components of parental care, between phylogenetically paired taxa from low- and high-elevation sites. We found that high-elevation species had significantly lower annual fecundity but provided greater parental care to their offspring. However, a strong negative relationship between offspring number and duration of parental care along the elevational gradient suggested that high-elevation species were shifting investment from offspring number toward offspring quality. Although adult survival did not differ between high- and low-elevation species, higher juvenile survival may have compensated for lower annual fecundity in high-elevation species. The elevation at which breeding occurred strongly influenced the partitioning of parental behavior between sexes. Male participation in nestling provisioning was significantly greater in high-elevation species. In turn, altitudinal variation in the frequency of biparental care closely covaries with the intensity of sexual selection, ultimately resulting in the strong elevational pattern of sexual dimorphism. Moreover, elevational variation in costs of development and maintenance of secondary sexual traits constitutes an additional effect on fecundity-survival schedules along elevational gradients. Thus, a trade-off between fecundity and parental care, and associated interactions among morphological, life history, and behavioral traits play important roles in the evolution of life history strategies in birds.},

   Abstract = {Most studies of condition-dependent sexual ornaments have treated such ornaments as single traits. However, sexual ornaments are often composites of several components, each produced by partially independent developmental pathways. Depending on environmental and individual condition, components of these ornaments may reflect different behavioral or physiological properties of an individual. One of the best- known, condition-dependent ornaments is carotenoid-based plumage coloration, which has at least four distinct components: pigment elaboration, patch area, pigment symmetry, and patch area symmetry. Here we examined fitness consequences of variation in individual components of carotenoid ornamentation in male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). Over 5 yr and several selection episodes, we studied variation in the plumage components in a large sample (n = 498) of males from a Montana population. The ornament components were partially independent of each other and had distinct fitness consequences. Selection for higher fecundity favored an increase in redness of coloration and a decrease in pigment asymmetry and patch area asymmetry but did not act on patch area itself. In contrast, viability selection favored larger and more symmetrical ornamental patches but did not act on pigment elaboration. Developmental and functional interrelationships among individual components of ornamentation strongly differed between house finch populations. Distinct patterns of selection on individual components of condition- dependent ornaments, combined with partially independent development of components, should favor the evolution of composite sexual traits whose components reliably reflect condition across a wide array of environments.},

Here we examine whether divergence in sexual dimorphism of adults between recently established Montana and Alabama populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) can be attributed to population differences in growth of males and females. In both populations, males and females were similar at hatching, but as a result of sex-specific growth attained sexual size dimorphism by the time of independence. Timing and extent of growth varied between the sexes: Females maintained maximum rates of growth for a longer time than males, whereas males had higher initial growth rates and achieved maximum growth earlier and at smaller sizes than females. Ontogeny of sexual dimorphism differed between populations, but in each population, sexual dimorphism in growth parameters and sexual dimorphism at the time of nest leaving were similar to sexual dimorphism of adults. Variation in growth of females contributed more to population divergence than did growth of males. In each population, we found close correspondence between patterns of sexual dimorphism in growth and population divergence in morphology of adults: Traits that were the most sexually dimorphic in growth in each population contributed the most to population divergence in both sexes. We suggest that sex-specific expression of phenotypic and genetic variation throughout the ontogeny of house finches can result in different responses to selection between males and females of the same age, and thus produce fast population divergence in the sexual size dimorphism.},

Yet, most studies of the evolution of dimorphism have focused on correlates of only adult morphologies. Here we examined the ontogeny of sexual size dimorphism in an isolated population of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). Sexes differed in growth rates and growth duration; in most traits, females grew faster than males, but males grew for a longer period. Sexual dimorphism in bill traits (bill length, width, depth) and in body traits (wing, tarsus, and tail length; mass) developed during different periods of ontogeny. Growth of bill traits was most different between sexes during the juvenile period (after leaving the nest), whereas growth of body traits was most sexually dimorphic during the first few days after hatching. Postgrowth selection on juveniles strongly influenced sexual dimorphism in all traits; in some traits, this selection canceled or reversed dimorphism patterns produced by growth differences between sexes. The net result was that adult sexual dimorphism, to a large degree, was an outcome of selection for survival during juvenile stages. We suggest that previously documented fast and extensive divergence of house finch populations in sexual size dimorphism may be partially produced by distinct environmental conditions during growth in these populations.},

Here we examined the relationship between song and plumage elaborations in cardueline finches, songbirds that are highly variable in plumage displays and songs, but that share a similar mating system. We statistically controlled for body mass, habitat characteristics. and phylogenetic relationships and found that across species song complexity was strongly negatively related to elaboration of plumage ornamentation. When plumage coloration was partitioned into carotenoid-based and melanin-based components, song complexity was negatively related to elaboration of male carotenoid-based coloration but unrelated to elaboration of melanin-based coloration. These observations support the idea that. for condition-dependent traits, animal species trade off trait expression in response to changes in the costs or the information content of these traits.

Here we examined reproductive tactics in relation to the elaboration of condition-dependent sexual ornamentation (carotenoid breast coloration) in a Montana population of the house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). Males used distinct reproductive tactics depending on elaboration of their sexual ornamentation. Males with red pigmentation (maximum ornament elaboration) paired with females that nested earlier, but these males did little provisioning of incubating females and nestlings. In contrast, males with yellow coloration paired with females that nested later, but these males fed female and nestlings more. Consequently, for red males offspring recruitment was primarily affected by earlier nest initiation, whereas in yellow males it was affected most by male provisioning. In males with intermediate plumage coloration, all measured components, nest initiation, provisioning of incubating female, and nestling feeding, strongly contributed to offspring recruitment. The fitness consequences of alternative reproductive tactics of males were influenced by breeding experience and fidelity of their mates. Among first-time breeders, red males achieved the highest fecundity because of the advantage gained through early nesting and pairing with more experienced females and because of compensation by their mates for low male provisioning of nestlings. Among experienced breeders, males with intermediate plumage coloration achieved the highest fecundity because of the combined benefits of relatively early pairing and high parental care. High variation in sexual ornamentation in a Montana population of house finches may favor distinct associations of sexual displays with a particular set of reproductive behaviors.},

Here we show that, in both populations, these maternal effects strongly biased frequency distribution of tarsus size of fully grown males and females and ultimately produced population divergence in this trait. Although in each population, male and female offspring show a wide range of growth patterns, maternal modifications of sex-ratio in relation to egg-laying order resulted in under-representation of the morphologies that were selected against and over- representation of morphologies that were favoured by the local selection on juveniles. The result of these maternal adjustments was fast phenotypic change in sexual size dimorphism within and between populations. Maternal manipulations of offspring morphologies may be especially important at the initial stages of population establishment in the novel environments and may have facilitated recent colonization of much of North America by the house finch.},

Whereas these maternal effects should evolve to accommodate the adaptations of both the maternal and offspring generations, the mechanisms by which this is accomplished are rarely known. In birds, females adjust the onset of incubation (coincident with the first egg or after all eggs are laid) in response to the environment during breeding, and thus, indirectly, determine the duration of offspring growth. In the two house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) populations that breed at the extremes of the species' distribution (Montana and Alabama),: females experience highly distinct climatic conditions during nesting. We show that in close association with these conditions, females adjusted jointly the onset of incubation and the sequence in which they produced male and female eggs and consequently modified the growth of sons and daughters. The onset of incubation in newly breeding females closely tracked ambient temperature in a pattern consistent with the maintenance of egg viability. Because of the very different climates in Montana and Alabama, females in these populations showed the opposite patterns of seasonal change in incubation onset and the opposite sex bias in egg-laying order. In females with breeding experience, incubation onset and sex bias in laying order were closely linked regardless of the climatic variation. In nests in which incubation began with the onset of egg laying, the first-laid eggs were mostly females in Montana, but mostly males in Alabama. Because in both populations, male, but not female, embryos grew faster when exposed to longer incubation, the sex-bias produced highly divergent sizes of male and female juveniles between the populations. Overall, the compensatory interaction between the onset of incubation and the sex-biased laying order achieved a compromise between maternal and offspring adaptations and contributed to rapid morphological divergence in sexual dimorphism between populations of the house finch breeding at the climatic extremes of the species range.},

In turn, selection for state- and context- specific expression of sexual ornamentation should favour the evolution of developmental pathways that enable the flexible allocation of resources into sexual ornamentation. We studied lifelong variation in the expression and condition-dependence of a sexual ornament in relation to age and the context of breeding in male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) - a species that develops a new sexual ornament once a year after breeding. Throughout males' lifetime, the elaboration of ornamentation and the allocation of resources to the development of sexual ornamentation depended strongly on pairing status in the preceding breeding season - males that were single invested more resources into sexual ornamentation and changed ornamentation more than males that were paired. During the initial (post-juvenile) moult, the expression of ornamentation was closely dependent on individual condition, however the condition-dependence of ornamentation sharply decreased throughout a male's lifetime and in older males expression of sexual ornamentation was largely independent of condition during moult. Selection for early breeding favoured greater ornamentation in males that were single in the preceding seasons and the strength of this selection increased with age. On the contrary, the strength of selection on sexual ornamentation decreased with age in males that were paired in the preceding breeding season. Our results reveal strong context-dependency in investment into sexual ornamentation as well as a high flexibility in the development of sexual ornamentation throughout a male's life.},

   Abstract = {Adaptive evolution is often strongly influenced by maternal inheritance that transfers the parental strategies across generations. The consequences of maternal effects for the offspring generation depend on the between-generation similarity in environments and on the evolved sensitivity of the offspring's ontogeny to maternal effects. When these factors differ between sons and daughters, maternal effects can influence the evolution of sexual dimorphism. The establishment of house finch populations across western Montana during the last 30 years was accompanied by rapid evolutionary change in sexual size dimorphism. Here I show that traits that changed the most across generations were most influenced by maternal effects in males but not females. Maternal effects differentially affected sons' and daughters' survival; greater maternal effects were commonly associated with higher survival of sons, especially when maternal and offspring environments were similar. Stronger maternal effects extended preselection phenotypic variance in morphological traits of males, thereby producing some locally adaptive phenotypes and lessening juvenile mortality. Thus, the observed sex-specific maternal effects and their contribution to the evolution of sexual size dimorphism are likely a passive consequence of the distinct sensitivity of sons and daughters to maternal adaptations to breeding in ecologically distinct parts of the house finch's expanding range.},

The evolutionary significance of such stress-induced variation depends on the recurrence of a stressor and on the degree to which developmental errors can be accommodated by an organism's ontogeny without significant loss of function. We subjected populations of four species of soricid shrews to an extreme environment during growth and measured changes in the patterns of integration and accommodation of stress-induced developmental errors in a complex of mandibular traits. Adults that grew under an extreme environment had lower integration of morphological variation among mandibular traits and highly elevated fluctuating asymmetry in these traits, compared to individuals that grew under the control conditions. However, traits differed strongly in the magnitude of response to a stressor - traits within attachments of the same muscle (functionally integrated traits) had lower response and changed their integration less than other traits. Cohesiveness in functionally integrated complexes of traits under stress was maintained by close covariation of their developmental variation. Such developmental accommodation of stress-induced variation might enable the individual's functioning and persistence under extreme environmental conditions and thus provides a link between individual adaptation to stress and the evolution of stress resistance.},

   Abstract = {Duration of developmental stages in animals evolves under contrasting selection pressures of age-specific mortality and growth requirements. When relative importance of these effects varies across environments, evolution of developmental periods is expected to be slow. In birds, maternal effects on egg-laying order and offspring growth, two proximate determinants of nestling period, should enable rapid adjustment of developmental periods to even widely fluctuating mortality rates. We test this hypothesis in a population of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) breeding under two contrasting mortality risks: (i) a nest mite-free condition when selection on offspring survival favors a longer time in the nest; and (it) a mite infestation when selection favors a shorter nest tenure. Mites affected survival of sons more than daughters, and females breeding under mite infestation laid male eggs last and female eggs first in the clutch, thereby reducing sons' exposure to mites and associated mortality. Strong sex bias in laying order and growth patterns enabled mite-infested offspring to achieve similar fledging size, despite a shorter nest tenure, compared with mite-free conditions. In mite-infested nests, male nestlings hatched at larger sizes, completed growth earlier, and had faster initial growth compared with mite-free nests, whereas mite-infested females grew more slowly but for a longer period of time. A combination of heavily sex-biased laying order and sex differences in growth patterns lowered mite-induced mortality by > 10% in both sexes. Thus, strong maternal effects can account for frequently observed, but theoretically unexpected, concordance of mortality risks and growth patterns, especially under fluctuating ecological conditions.},

Evolutionary geneticists have expended tremendous effort to estimate the genome-wide rate of mutation and the effects of new mutations on fitness, but the degree to which genomic mutational properties vary within and between taxa is largely unknown, particularly in multicellular organisms. Beginning with two highly inbred strains from each of three species in the nematode family Rhabditidae (Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Oscheius myriophila), we allowed mutations to accumulate in the relative absence of natural selection for 200 generations. We document significant variation in the rate of decay of fitness because of new mutations between strains and between species. Estimates of the per-generation mutational decay of fitness were very consistent within strains between assays 100 generations apart. Rate of mutational decay in fitness was positively associated with genomic mutation rate and negatively associated with average mutational effect. These results provide unambiguous experimental evidence for substantial variation in genome-wide properties of mutation both within and between species and reinforce conclusions from previous experiments that the cumulative effects on fitness of new mutations can differ markedly among related taxa.},

Such secondary sexual traits are assumed to be costly to produce and maintain, and they usually are accompanied by morphological adaptations that tend to reduce their costs. The aerodynamic costs for male barn swallows Hirundo rustica of having long tails were quantified using aerodynamics theory applied to morphological data from seven European populations. Latitudinal differences in tail length were positively correlated with differences in flight costs predicted by aerodynamics theory. A positive relationship between aerodynamic costs of long tails and the degree of sexual size dimorphism was found among populations. Latitudinal differences in foraging costs may result in tail length being relatively similar in males and females in southern populations, whereas the low foraging costs for males in northern populations may allow them to cope with higher aerodynamic costs, giving rise to large sexual size dimorphism. Enlargement of wingspan in males can alleviate but not eliminate the costs of tail exaggeration, and therefore differences in aerodynamic costs of male ornaments were maintained among populations. Sexual size dimorphism in the barn swallow arises as a consequence of latitudinal differences in the advantages of sexual selection for males and the costs of long tails for males and females.},

   Journal = {Evolution},
   Volume = {58},
   Number = {10},
   Pages = {2111-2132},
   Abstract = {We analyze the changes in the mean and variance components of a quantitative trait caused by changes in allele frequencies, concentrating on the effects of genetic drift. We use a general representation of epistasis and dominance that allows an arbitrary relation between genotype and phenotype for any number of diallelic loci. We assume initial and final Hardy- Weinberg and linkage equilibrium in our analyses of drift- induced changes. Random drift generates transient linkage disequilibria that cause correlations between allele frequency fluctuations at different loci. However, we show that these have negligible effects, at least for interactions among small numbers of loci. Our analyses are based on diffusion approximations that summarize the effects of drift in terms of F, the inbreeding coefficient, interpreted as the expected proportional decrease in heterozygosity at each locus. For haploids, the variance of the trait mean after a population bottleneck is var(Delta(z) over bar) = Sigma(k)(=1)(n) (FVA(k))-V-k, where n is the number of loci contributing to the trait variance, V-A(1) = V-A is the additive genetic variance, and V-A(k) is the kth-order additive epistatic variance. The expected additive genetic variance after the bottleneck, denoted <V-A(*)> is closely related to var(Delta(z) over bar); <V-A(*)> = (1 - F) Sigma(k)(=1)(n) kF(k-1) V-A(k). Thus, epistasis inflates the expected additive variance above V-A(1 - F), the expectation under additivity. For haploids (and diploids without dominance), the expected value of every variance component is inflated by the existence of higher order interactions (e.g., third-order epistasis inflates <V-AA(*)>). This is not true in general with diploidy, because dominance alone can reduce <VA(*)> below V-A(1 - F) (e.g., when dominant alleles are rare). Without A dominance, diploidy produces simple expressions: var(Delta(z) over bar) = Sigma(k)(=1)(n) (2F)(k) V-k(A(k)) and <V-A(*)> = (1 - F) Sigma(k)(=1)(n) k(2F)V-k-1(A(k).) k With dominance (and even without epistasis), var(Delta(z) over bar) and no longer depend solely on the variance components in the base population. For small F, the expected additive variance simplifies to <V-A(*)> similar or equal to (1 - F)V-A +4FV(AA) + 2FV(D) + 2FC(AD), where C-AD is a sum of two terms describing covariances between additive effects and dominance and additive X dominance interactions. Whether population bottlenecks lead to expected increases in additive variance depends primarily on the ratio of nonadditive to additive genetic variance in the base population, but dominance precludes simple predictions based solely on variance components. We illustrate these results using a model in which genotypic values are drawn at random, allowing extreme and erratic epistatic interactions. Although our analyses clarify the conditions under which drift is expected to increase V-A, we question the evolutionary importance of such increases.},

   Abstract = {The existence of adaptive phenotypic plasticity demands that we study the evolution of reaction norms, rather than just the evolution of fixed traits. This approach requires the examination of functional relationships among traits not only in a single environment but across environments and between traits and plasticity itself. In this study, I examined the interplay of plasticity and local adaptation of offspring size in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Guppies respond to food restriction by growing and reproducing less but also by producing larger offspring. This plastic difference in offspring size is of the same order of magnitude as evolved genetic differences among populations. Larger offspring sizes are thought to have evolved as an adaptation to the competitive environment faced by newborn guppies in some environments. If plastic responses to maternal food limitation can achieve the same fitness benefit, then why has guppy offspring size evolved at all? To explore this question, I examined the plastic response to food level of females from two natural populations that experience different selective environments. My goals were to examine whether the plastic responses to food level varied between populations, test the consequences of maternal manipulation of offspring size for offspring fitness, and assess whether costs of plasticity exist that could account for the evolution of mean offspring size across populations. In each population, full-sib sisters were exposed to either a low- or high-food treatment. Females from both populations produced larger, leaner offspring in response to food limitation. However, the population that was thought to have a history of selection for larger offspring was less plastic in its investment per offspring in response to maternal mass, maternal food level, and fecundity than the population under selection for small offspring size. To test the consequences of maternal manipulation of offspring size for offspring fitness, I raised the offspring of low- and high-food mothers in either low- or high-food environments. No maternal effects were detected at high food levels, supporting the prediction that mothers should increase fecundity rather than offspring size in noncompetitive environments. For offspring raised under low food levels, maternal effects on juvenile size and male size at maturity varied significantly between populations, reflecting their initial differences in maternal manipulation of offspring size; nevertheless, in both populations, increased investment per offspring increased offspring fitness. Several correlates of plasticity in investment per offspring that could affect the evolution of offspring size in guppies were identified. Under low-food conditions, mothers from more plastic families invested more in future reproduction and less in their own soma. Similarly, offspring from more plastic families were smaller as juveniles and female offspring reproduced earlier. These correlations suggest that a fixed, high level of investment per offspring might be favored over a plastic response in a chronically low-resource environment or in an environment that selects for lower reproductive effort.},

   Abstract = {Due to practical difficulties in obtaining direct genetic estimates of effective sizes, conservation biologists have to rely on so-called 'demographic models' which combine life-history and mating-system parameters with F-statistics in order to produce indirect estimates of effective sizes. However, for the same practical reasons that prevent direct genetic estimates, the accuracy of demographic models is difficult to evaluate. Here we use individual-based, genetically explicit computer simulations in order to investigate the accuracy of two such demographic models aimed at investigating the hierarchical structure of populations. We show that, by and large, these models provide good estimates under a wide range of mating systems and dispersal patterns. However, one of the models should be avoided whenever the focal species' breeding system approaches monogamy with no sex bias in dispersal or when a substructure within social groups is suspected because effective sizes may then be strongly overestimated. The timing during the life cycle at which F-statistics are evaluated is also of crucial importance and attention should be paid to it when designing field sampling since different demographic models assume different timings. Our study shows that individual-based, genetically explicit models provide a promising way of evaluating the accuracy of demographic: models of effective size and delineate their field of applicability.},

Hamilton's indicators are decreasing functions of age. He concluded that senescence is inevitable: survival and fertility decline with age. I show that alternative parameterizations of mutational effects lead to indicators that can increase with age. I then consider the case of deleterious mutations with age-specific effects. In this case, it is the balance between mutation and selection pressure that determines the equilibrium number of mutations in a population. In this balance, the effects of different parameterizations cancel out, but only to a linear approximation. I show that mutation accumulation has little impact at ages when this linear approximation holds. When mutation accumulation matters, nonlinear effects become important, and the parameterizations of mutational effects make a difference. The results also suggest that mutation accumulation may be relatively unimportant over most of the reproductive lifespan of any species.},

A linearizing transform is used with a linear nummax approximation to determine an optimal lognormal approximation to a lognormal sum distribution.

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

The method gives the posterior distribution of effective population size at the time of the oldest sample and at the time of the most recent sample, assuming a model of exponential growth or decline during the interval. The effect of changes in number of alleles, number of loci, and sample size on the accuracy of the method is described using test simulations, and it is concluded that these have an approximately equivalent effect. The method is used on three example data sets and problems in interpreting the posterior densities are highlighted and discussed.},

   Abstract = {Long-term phenotypic evolution can be modeled using the response-to-selection equation of quantitative genetics, which incorporates information about genetic constraints (the G matrix). However, little is known about the evolution of G and about its long-term importance in constraining phenotypic evolution. We first investigated the degree of conservation of the G matrix across three species of crickets and qualitatively compared the pattern of variation of G to the phylogeny of the group. Second, we investigated the effect of G on phenotypic evolution by comparing the direction of greatest quantitative genetic variation within species (g(max)) to the direction of phenotypic divergence between species (Deltaz). Each species, Gryllus veletis, G. firmus, and G. pennsylvanicus, was reared in the laboratory using a full-sib breeding design to extract quantitative genetic information. Five morphological traits related to size were measured. G matrices were compared using three statistical approaches: the T method, the Flury hierarchy, and the MANOVA method. Results revealed that the differences between matrices were small and mostly caused by differences in the magnitude of the genetic variation, not by differences in principal component structure. This suggested that the G matrix structure of this group of species was preserved, despite significant phenotypic divergence across species. The small observed differences in G matrices across species were qualitatively consistent with genetic distances, whereas ecological information did not provide a good prediction of G matrix variation. The comparison of g(max) and Delta(z) over bar revealed that the angle between these two vectors was small in two of three species comparisons, whereas the larger angle corresponding to the third species comparison was caused in large part by one of the five traits. This suggests that multivariate phenotypic divergence occurred mostly in a direction predicted by the direction of greatest genetic variation, although it was not possible to demonstrate the causal relationship from G to Delta(z) over bar. Overall, this study provided some support for the validity of the predictive power of quantitative genetics over evolutionary time scales.},

   Abstract = {In male House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), the extent and color of plumage varies depending on access to carotenoid pigments. ''Colorful'' males exhibit extensive red pigmentation, while less colorful (i.e., ''drab'') males exhibit carotenoid pigmentation over a smaller percentage of their plumage, pigmentation of a color besides red (e.g., yellow, gold, orange, or pink), or both. One explanation for maintenance of plumage variation is that it reliably reflects social status, allowing males to correctly assess their status in relation to others and avoid or minimize costly fights. Social relationships may also be related to endogenous factors, such as circulating levels of the hormones testosterone and corticosterone. High levels of testosterone may promote or facilitate increased aggression, and stress associated with receiving aggression from individuals of higher status may increase adrenal activity and secretion of corticosterone. We examined the relationship between plumage variability, steroid hormones, and social status in captive male House Finches during the non-breeding period in: (1) groups of males in which individuals varied by age, size, and plumage, and (2) pairs (dyads) of males matched for several measurable parameters except plumage. Testosterone and social status were not related in males competing in either groups or dyads, and levels of testosterone were routinely low. Corticosterone and status were not related in groups but, in dyads where subordinate individuals had little chance of escaping aggression from more dominant birds, subordinates exhibited significantly greater levels of corticosterone. Although drab males tended to achieve higher status than colorful males in both experiments, which is consistent with previous studies on free-living individuals, we could not reject the null hypothesis that plumage and status were unrelated. We conclude that dominance relationships among male House Finches during the non-breeding season may not be related to testosterone, but they are reflected by levels of corticosterone in some circumstances. Additionally, colorful plumage appears to be a poor predictor of high social status among male House Finches during the non-breeding season.},

One benefit of this technique is its ability to discern the direct action of selection on traits by removing effects of correlated traits. However, covariation among traits expressed at different stages in an organism's life history is often poorly estimated because individuals that die before reaching adulthood cannot be measured as adults. Accurate estimates of trait covariances are necessary for the correct interpretation of the direct action of selection on a trait. If phenotypic characters expressed at different life-history stages are of interest, and mortality occurs between stages, the components of the selection model will be biased by not including those Individuals that died (the ''invisible fraction''). A laboratory experiment was designed using the common understory annual jewelweed (Impatiens pallida) to investigate the importance of this ''invisible fraction'' in the quantification of the strength of natural selection. Nine seedlings were planted into each of 40 plastic tubs. After 1 mo, half of these tubs were thinned by removing the four smallest plants. In the other half, the four largest plants were removed. Conditional directional selection gradients were significantly different for several traits between these two experimental populations, and differences in phenotypic variance-covariance matrices appear to have affected these estimates. These results suggest that methods such as those proposed by Lynch and Arnold should be applied to selection analyses in which within-generation mortality occurs and estimates of lifetime selection are desired.},

Using this approach, we show that continuous signalling games can have low-cost separating equilibria despite conflicting interests between signaller and receiver. We find that contrary to prior arguments, honesty does not require wasteful signals. Finally, we examine signalling games in which different signallers have different minimal-cost signals, and provide a mathematical justification for the argument that even non-signalling traits will be exaggerated beyond their phenotypic optimum when they are used by other individuals to judge condition or quality.},

   Abstract = {We present an algorithm to partition a single generation of individuals into full-sib families using single-locus co-dominant marker data. Pairwise likelihood ratios are used to create a graph that represents the full-sib relationships within the data set. Connected-component and minimum-cut algorithms from the graph theory are then employed to find the full-sib families within the graph. The results of a large-scale simulation study show that the algorithm is able to produce accurate partitions when applied to data sets with eight or more loci. Although the algorithm performs best when the distribution of allele frequencies and family sizes in a data set is uniform, the inclusion of more loci or alleles per locus allows accurate partitions to be created from data sets in which these distributions are highly skewed.},

We present a comparative analysis of mammalian life histories showing that, for mammals at least, there is not a single fast-slow continuum. Rather, both across and within mammalian clades, the speed of life varies along at least two largely independent axes when body size effects are removed. One axis reflects how species balance offspring size against offspring number, while the other describes the timing of reproductive bouts.},

   Abstract = {Interaction among individuals is universal, both in animals and in plants, and substantially affects evolution of natural populations and responses to artificial selection in agriculture. Although quantitative genetics has successfully been applied to many traits, it does not provide a general theory accounting for interaction among individuals and selection acting on multiple levels. Consequently, Current quantitative genetic theory fails to explain why some traits do not respond to selection among individuals, but respond greatly to selection among groups. Understanding the full impacts of heritable interactions on the Outcomes of selection requires a quantitative genetic framework including all levels of selection and relatedness. Here we present such a framework and provide expressions for the response to selection. Results show that interaction among individuals may create substantial heritable variation, which is hidden to classical analyses. Selection acting on higher levels of organization captures this hidden variation and therefore always yields positive response, whereas individual selection may yield response in the opposite direction. Our work provides testable predictions of response to multilevel selection and reduces to classical theory in the absence of interaction. Statistical methodology provided elsewhere enables empirical application of our work to both natural and domestic populations.},

Understanding the consequences of these interactions for the evolution of populations by either natural or artificial selection requires knowledge of the heritable components underlying them. Here we present statistical methodology to estimate the genetic parameters determining response to multilevel selection of traits affected by interactions among individuals in general populations. We apply these methods to obtain estimates of genetic parameters for survival, days in a population of layer chickens with high mortality due to pecking behavior. We find that heritable variation is threefold greater than that obtained from classical analyses, meaning that two-thirds of the full heritable variation is hidden to classical analysis due to social interactions. As a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to this population are threefold greater than classical predictions. This work, combined with the quantitative genetic theory for response to multilevel selection presented in an accompanying article in this issue, enables the design of selection programs to effectively reduce competitive interactions in livestock and plants and the prediction of the effects of social interactions on evolution in natural populations undergoing multilevel selection.},

Our analyses of how extant lineages accumulated through time show that net per-lineage diversification rates barely changed across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. Instead, these rates spiked significantly with the origins of the currently recognized placental superorders and orders approximately 93 million years ago, before falling and remaining low until accelerating again throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs. Our results show that the phylogenetic 'fuses' leading to the explosion of extant placental orders are not only very much longer than suspected previously, but also challenge the hypothesis that the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event had a major, direct influence on the diversification of today's mammals.},

   Abstract = {The lek paradox, in which female choice erodes genetic variation in male sexually selected traits, is a fundamental issue in sexual selection. If females gain only genetic benefits from preferentially having their ova fertilized by males with particular traits, what maintains variation in these traits? Under strong directional selection mediated through mate choice, the alleles for beneficial male traits are expected to go to fixation and exhibit little variation. A theoretical solution to the lek paradox is the genic capture hypothesis which states that: costly male traits subject to female choice are condition dependent, that male condition is dependent on genes at many loci and exhibits additive genetic variance, and that positive genetic correlations exist between sexually selected traits and condition. Using a captive population of the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, we tested two key predictions from this model: (1) that genetic variance exists in beak color which is a sexually selected trait, but also in condition and immune function, and (2) that positive genetic correlations exist between condition and beak color, and between beak color, condition, and immune function. Genetic parameters were estimated from a large breeding experiment involving 81 sires, 972 offspring, a pedigree of 1526 individuals, using the animal model. We employed the following index of body condition: residuals from a log-log plot of body mass on tarsus length following a standardized and extended period of exercise, in which residual mass is known to reflect fat and protein reserves. Our results were broadly consistent with the genic capture hypothesis because we found (1) additive genetic variation in beak color and immune function and condition, and (2) positive genetic correlations between condition and beak color, and between condition, beak color, and several assays of immune responsiveness. However, both of these results need qualification. In the first case we identified an important general problem in estimating the coefficient of additive genetic variance (CVA) in body condition. In the second case, although most of the genetic correlations were positive as predicted, only some were statistically significant, possibly due to our relatively small sample sizes, because genetic correlations typically have large standard errors and therefore require very large samples to be statistically significant. The statistically significant, positive genetic correlations included those between beak color and immune function (response to tetanus), and between immune function (response to tetanus) and condition, both of which indicate that females gain good genes from mating with males in good condition and/or with a redder beak color. We discuss the implications of our results for devising more rigorous but pragmatic tests of the genic capture hypothesis.},

A size- index was used to analyse patterns of variation and covariation across ages (2, 5, 8, 11 and 14 days). Genetic variation was analysed using mother-, father-; and midparent-offspring regressions in the blue tit. Phenotypic variation in growth was limited to a few dimensions only, while heritabilities were close to zero at all ages except at 2 days when a significant mother-offspring relation was found. The phenotypic variance- covariance matrix over ages was found to be singular, which suggests that there are trajectories for which there is no phenotypic variation, and which therefore they cannot evolve. The phenotypic growth trajectory associated with the largest amount of variation basically showed a high to moderately high covariation across ages. These results have macroevolutionary implications in terms of the outcome of selection which generally will be in terms of overall size changes but with a slow rate of change due to low heritabilities; an outcome consistent with macro-evolutionary patterns of morphological variation in birds. A simulation study supported the conclusion that high covariances among traits and ages call impose considerable constraint on a microevolutionary scale.},

There was little phenotypic variation in growth trajectories: individuals that were small (in relation to the mean) early in life were among the smallest 2.5 years later. If the genetic variation reflects phenotypic variation, not much evolutionary change can be expected. Our results show that there are ecological conditions that determine the strong covariation of size across ages, most likely size-related dominance behaviour, which can mask the true variation of growth patterns.

   Abstract = {The constancy of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G matrix) across environments and populations has been discussed and tested empirically over the years but no consensus has so far been reached. In this paper, I present a model in which morphological traits develop hierarchically, and individuals differ in their resource allocation and acquisition patterns. If the variance in resource acquisition is many times larger than the variance in resource allocation then strong genetic correlations are expected, and with almost isometric relations among traits. As the variation in resource acquisition decreases below a certain threshold, the correlations decrease overall and the relations among traits become a function of the allocation patterns, and in particular reflecting the basal division of allocation. A strong bottleneck can break a pattern of strong genetic correlation, but this effect diminishes rapidly with increasing bottleneck size. This model helps to understand why some populations change their genetic correlations in different environments, whereas others do not, since the key factor is the relation between the variances in resource acquisition and allocation. If a change in environment does not lead to a change in this ratio, no change can be expected, whereas if the ratio is changed substantially then major changes can be expected. This model can also help to understand the constancy of morphological patterns within larger taxa as a function of constancy in resource acquisition patterns over time and environments. When this pattern breaks, for example on islands, larger changes can be expected.},

   Abstract = {It is widely agreed that fecundity selection and sexual selection are the major evolutionary forces that select for larger body size in moss organisms. The general, equilibrium view is that selection for large body size is eventually counterbalanced by opposing selective forces. While the evidence for selection favoring larger body size is overwhelming, counterbalancing selection favoring small body size is often masked by the good condition of the larger organism and is therefore less obvious. The suggested costs of large size are: (1) viability costs in juveniles due to long development and/or fast growth; (2) viability costs in adults and juveniles due to predation, parasitism, or starvation because of reduced agility, increased detectability, higher energy requirements, heat stress, and/or intrinsic costs of reproduction; (3) decreased mating success of large males due to reduced agility and/or high energy requiremats;and (4) decreased reproductive success of large females and males due to late reproduction. A review of the literature indicates a substantial lack of empirical evidence for these various mechanisms and highlights the need for experimental studies that specifically address the fitness costs of being large at the ecological, physiological, and genetic levels. Specifically, theoretical investigations and comprehensive case studies of particular model species are needed to elucidate whether sporadic selection in time and space is sufficient to counter balance perpetual and strong selection for large body size.},

Carotenoid-based breast feathers of male linnets (Carduelis cannabina) increased in hue (redness), saturation and brightness after exposing them to outdoor conditions from winter to spring. This represents the first experimental evidence showing that carotenoid-based plumage coloration may increase towards a colourful expression due to biotic or abiotic environmental factors acting directly on full-grown feathers when carotenoids may be fully functional. Sunlight ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was hypothesized to denature keratin and other proteins that might protect pigments from degradation by this and other environmental factors, suggesting that sunlight UV irradiation is a major factor in the colour increase from winter to spring. Feather proteins and other binding molecules, if existing in the follicles, may be linked to carotenoids since their deposition into feathers to protect colourful features of associated carotenoids during the non-breeding season when its main signalling function may be relaxed. Progress towards uncovering the significance of concealment and subsequent display of colour expression should consider the potential binding and protecting nature of feather proteins associated with carotenoids.},

However, carotenoid reflectance spectra are intrinsically bimodal, with a less prominent but highly variable secondary reflectance peak at near-ultraviolet (UV; 320-400 nm) wavelengths visible to most birds but not to normal humans. Analysis of physical reflectance spectra of carotenoid-bearing plumages among trophically diverse tanagers (Thraupini, Emberizinae, Passeriformes) indicated that both the absolute and relative (to long visible wavelengths) amounts of short waveband (including UV) reflectance were lower in more frugivorous species. Striking modifications to the branched structure of feathers increased with frugivory. These associations were independent of phylogenetic relatedness, or other physical (specimen age, number of carotenoid-bearing patches) or ecological (body size, elevation) variables. By comparison, reflectance at longer visible wavelengths ('redness') was not consistently associated with diet. The reflectance patterns that distinguished frugivores should be more apparent to UV-sensitive birds than to UV-blind humans, but humans can perceive the higher plumage gloss produced by modified gross feather structure. Basic aspects of carotenoid chemistry suggest that increases in pigment concentration and feather dimensions reduce short waveband reflectance by the plumages of frugivores.},

   Abstract = {This paper reviews ecological and evolutionary processes that operate among and within insular communities, species and populations. Being basically non-evolutionary the MacArthur and Wilson's paradigm of island biogeography holds well in explaining processes that operate on the short ecological time, and proved to be helpful in explaining such issues as colonisation-extinction processes, species richness at equilibrium and species turnover. But several limitations make it insufficient as a modern tool for explaining evolutionary changes on islands. Colonising an island necessarily entails rapid evolutionary changes as a response to both non-selective and selective evolution. This results in a cascade of changes of life history traits, the so-called insular syndrome. Components of this syndrome include changes in morphology (size and shape), demography (age-specific fecundity, survival, dispersal) and behaviour. Shifts in behaviour are among the most spectacular features in insular vertebrates. Surprisingly few systematic and broad-scale analyses of demographic changes on islands have been designed to document the classical tenet of evolutionary shifts from high reproductive rates and short life span towards the opposite combination of life history traits as a result of high intraspecific competition in crowded insular populations. Examples of shifts in life history traits are given from a detailed case study on the biology of Blue tits in the island of Corsica, and most of these changes fit the predictions of an insular syndrome. An interesting trend resulting from shift from dispersal to sedentariness and habitat fidelity in islands is the potential far population differentiation at much smaller spatial scales than an mainland regions. This results in enhancing within-species diversity which counterbalances the species impoverishment of insular biotas. Although ecological adjustments and evolutionary changes make insular communities self-regulating assemblages of species that are resistant face to the risks of spontaneous extinction and invasion, insular communities are among the most vulnerable biota on Earth. The most important threats to island birds are discussed and some directions are given for promoting studies that could contribute to fill the most important gaps in our knowledge on evolution on islands and contribute to conservation issues.},

   Abstract = {Few empirical studies of bird populations have examined in detail how proximate and ultimate factors determine phenotypic variation in relation to small-scale environmental variation. This question has been addressed in the Alediterranean region, using blue tit (Parus caeruleus) populations living in habitat patches dominated either by deciduous (Quercus humilis) or evergreen (Q. ilex) oaks, which strongly differ in the timing and abundance of food resources. Our aim was threefold: 1) to analyse phenotypic variation and local differentiation of fitness-related life history traits on the scale of habitat mosaics within two different landscapes, one in mainland southern France and one on the island of Corsica; 2) to examine to what extent phenotypic variation is all ultimate response to local selection regimes and results in local adaptation; 3) to investigate whether phenotypic variation correlates with the genetic structure of populations. In the mainland landscape, where tits are assumed to disperse, freely across habitat patches, little local differentiation of breeding traits has been found within a range of ca 40 km, suggesting gene swamping between populations. A molecular genetics study of populations within this landscape supported the hypothesis of a source-sink population structure with more birds immigrating from deciduous habitat patches to evergreen ones than the reverse. In a similar geographic configuration of habitats in Corsica, there was a higher phenotypic variation and a higher degree of population differentiation on a scale which is usually smaller than the dispersal range of blue tits. This difference between the mainland and Corsica is interpreted as resulting from reduced dispersal ranges of island birds and supports the divergence-with-gene-flow model of speciation.},

Two populations of blue tits provide an interesting case study for testing these hypotheses because they live in contrasting environments in continental France and in Corsica and exhibit different degree of sexual size dimorphism. Contrary to several predictions, the insular population is less dimorphic than the continental one but neither the sexual selection hypothesis nor the niche variation hypothesis explain the observed patterns. In the mainland population it is advantageous for both sexes to be large, and males are larger than females. In Corsica, however, reproductive success was greater for pairs in which the male was relatively small, i.e. pairs in which sexual size dimorphism is reduced. The most likely explanation is that interpopulation differences in sexual size dimorphism are determined not by sex-related factors, but by differences in sex-specific reproductive roles and responses to environmental factors. Because of environmental stress on the island as a result of food shortage and high parasite infestations, the share of parents in caring for young favours small size in males so that a reduced sexual size dimorphism is not the target of selection but a by-product of mechanisms that operate at the level of individual sexes.},

We measured allele frequencies at 20 unlinked, dinucleotide-repeat microsatellite loci in a population of wild mice (Mus musculus), and used these observed frequencies to generate the expected distributions of pairwise relatedness among full sib, half sib, and unrelated pairs of individuals, as would be estimated from the microsatellite data. In this population one should be able to discriminate between unrelated and full-sib dyads with at least 97% accuracy, and to discriminate half-sib pairs from unrelated pairs or from full-sib pairs with better than 80% accuracy. If one uses the criterion that parent-offspring pairs must share at least one allele per locus, then only 15% of full-sib pairs, 2% of half-sib pairs, and 0% of unrelated pairs in this population would qualify as potential parent-offspring pairs. We verified that the simulation results (which assume a random mating population in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium) accurately predict results one would obtain from this population in real life by scoring laboratory-bred full- and half-sib families whose parents were wild-caught mice from the study population. We also investigated the effects of using different numbers of loci, or loci of different average heterozygosities (He), on misclassification frequencies. Both variables have strong effects on misclassification rate. For example, it requires almost twice as many loci of He = 0.62 to achieve the same accuracy as a given number of loci of HE = 0.75. Finally, we tested the ability of UPGMA clustering to identify family groups in our population. Clustering of allele matching scores among the offspring of four sets of independent maternal half sibships (four females, each mated to two different males) perfectly recovered the true family relationships.},

But animals must ultimately obtain carotenoids in the diet, and metabolic conversion of carotenoids is inefficient and expends energy. It has therefore been suggested that carotenoid supply may be limiting to animals. 3. Prelaying, wild Lesser Black-Backed Gulls (Larus fuscus L.) were given supplementary feed with a cocktail of four carotenoids, or a carotenoid-free (control) supplement. The yolk carotenoid profile and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation were then compared in eggs that they laid. 4. In comparison with controls, there was an increase in the yolk concentrations of seven carotenoids, and also unidentified carotenoids in eggs produced by carotenoid-supplemented females. However, the relative proportions of five classes of carotenoid did not differ significantly, and consequently the percentage profile of yolk carotenoids was positively correlated, between feeding treatments, possibly indicating metabolic transformations and differential transfer of carotenoids from maternal diet to yolk. 5. Moreover, in control eggs relatively few possible correlations between carotenoid concentrations were significantly positive, and some correlations between carotenoid proportions were significantly negative, suggesting physiological discrimination. 6. Egg yolk produced by carotenoid-supplemented females was significantly less susceptible to lipid peroxidation in comparison with controls. 7. These results suggest that yolk enrichment with carotenoids involves physiological discrimination in gulls, highlighting a previously unstudied, potential cost of reproduction.},

However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie this maternal effect are poorly understood. Carotenoids are hypothesized to enhance antioxidant activity and immune function, and are responsible for the pigmentation of egg yolk. The proximate basis and consequences of this maternal investment, however, have not previously been studied in wild birds. In this supplemental feeding study of lesser black-backed gulls, Larus fuscus, carotenoid-fed females are shown to have increased integument pigmentation, higher plasma concentrations of carotenoids and antioxidant activity, and lower plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins (Igs) in comparison with controls. In turn, carotenoid-fed females produced eggs containing high carotenoid but low Ig concentrations (i.e. passive immunity), whereas control females produced eggs containing low carotenoid but high Ig concentrations. Within-clutch patterns of these resources varied over the laying sequence in a similar manner in both carotenoid-fed and control nests. Our results suggest that carotenoids could be one resource responsible for egg quality maternal effects in birds. We discuss the possible implications of carotenoid-mediated effects on phenotype for fitness in mothers and their offspring.},

However, whether variation in circulating carotenoid levels causes variation in both immune function and sexual attractiveness has not been determined in any species.

Trade-offs in the allocation of limiting carotenoids between somatic maintenance and egg production could therefore be an important factor underlying reproductive costs. We show that in wild lesser black-backed gulls, Larus fuscus, dietary carotenoid availability (i) constrained the capacity to re-lay following clutch removal; and (ii) affected the relationship between yolk mass and egg mass.

A quantitative genetic analysis using 30 populations of hybrids between the two species indicated that mating success in hybrid individuals was predominately determined by cuticular hydrocarbons; the average genetic correlation between mating success and cuticular hydrocarbon profile was 0.84, and in some instances exceeded 0.95. Multivariate analysis of the cuticular hydrocarbons of the two species revealed that there were three independent blends of cuticular hydrocarbons that separated three levels of organization: species, sex, and sex within species. The hydrocarbons used by hybrids in mate choice included those that separated the two species, demonstrating that species-specific characters may be used in mate choice within populations.

Although the existence of such genetic correlations has been investigated in a number of taxa, it has yet to be shown that such correlations evolve and whether they may evolve as rapidly as suggested by sexual selection models. In this study, I used a hybridization experiment to disrupt natural mate recognition systems and then observed the subsequent evolutionary dynamics of the genetic correlation between male and female components for 56 generations in hybrids between Drosophila serrata and Drosophila birchii. The genetic correlation between male and female components evolved from 0.388 at generation 5 to 1.017 at generation 37 and then declined to -0.040 after a further 19 generations. These results indicated that the genetic basis of the mate recognition system in the hybrid populations evolved rapidly. The initial rapid increase in the genetic correlation was consistent with the classic assumption that male and female components will coevolve under sexual selection. The subsequent decline in genetic correlation may be attributable to the fixation of major genes or, alternatively, may be a result of a cyclic evolutionary change in mate recognition.},

Here, we tested whether the repeated evolution of reproductive character displacement in natural and experimental populations was a consequence of genetic constraints on the evolution of CHCs. The genetic variance- covariance (G) matrices for CHCs were determined for populations of D. serrata that had evolved in either the presence or absence of D. birchii under field and experimental conditions. Natural selection on mate recognition under both field and experimental sympatric conditions increased the genetic variance in CHCs consistent with a response to selection based on rare alleles. A close association between G eigenstructure and the eigenstructure of the phenotypic divergence (D) matrix in natural and experimental populations suggested that G matrix eigenstructure may have determined the direction in which reproductive character displacement evolved during the reinforcement of mate recognition.},

We apply these approaches to a set of male sexually selected cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of Drosophila serrata. Even though male CHCs displayed substantial additive genetic variance, more than 99% of the genetic variance was orientated 74.9degrees away from the vector of linear sexual selection, suggesting that open-ended female preferences may greatly reduce genetic variation in male display traits. Although the orientation of G and the fitness surface were found to differ significantly, the similarity present in eigenstructure was a consequence of traits under weak linear selection and strong nonlinear ( convex) selection. Associating the eigenstructure of G with vectors of linear and nonlinear selection may provide a way of determining what long-term changes in G may be generated by the processes of natural and sexual selection.},

We review a range of theoretical and empirical results covering single traits to more complex multivariate systems, and show that an absence of genetic variance may be more common than is currently appreciated. From a single-trait perspective, we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically important traits. A common misconception in many life-history studies is that a lack of genetic variance in single traits, and genetic constraints as a consequence of bivariate genetic correlations, are different causes of selection limits. We detail how interpretations of bivariate patterns are unlikely to demonstrate genetic limits to selection in many cases. We advocate a multivariate definition of genetic constraints that emphasizes the presence (or otherwise) of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection. For multitrait systems, recent results using longer term studies of organisms, in which more is understood concerning what traits may be under selection, have indicated that selection may exhaust genetic variance, resulting in a limit to the selection response.},

However, many behavioral ecologists are uncertain about the value of including a genetic component in their studies. In this article, we review how genetic analyses of behavior are central to topics ranging from understanding past selection and predicting future evolution to explaining the neural and hormonal control of behavior. Furthermore, we review both new and old techniques for studying evolutionary behavior genetics and highlight how the choice of approach depends on both the question and the organism. Topics discussed include genetic architecture, detecting the past history of selection, and genotype-by-environment interactions. We show how these questions are being addressed with techniques including statistical genetics, QTL analyses, transgenic analyses, and microarrays. Many of the techniques were first applied to the behavior of genetic model organisms such as laboratory mice and flies. Two recent developments serve to expand the relevance of such studies to behavioral ecology. The first is to use model organisms for studies of the genetic basis of evolutionarily relevant behavior and the second is to apply methods developed in model genetic systems to species that have not previously been examined genetically. These conceptual advances, along with the rapid diversification of genetic tools and the recognition of widespread genetic homology, suggest a bright outlook for evolutionary genetic studies. This review provides access to tools through references to the recent literature and shows the great promise for evolutionary behavioral genetics.},

   Abstract = {Relative-pair designs are routinely employed in linkage studies of complex genetic diseases and quantitative traits. Valid application of these methods requires correct specification of the relationships of the pairs. For example, within a sibship, presumed full sibs actually might be MZ twins, half sibs, or unrelated. Misclassification of half-sib pairs or unrelated individuals as full sibs can result in reduced power to detect linkage. When other family members, such as parents or additional siblings, are available, incorrectly specified relationships usually will be detected through apparent incompatibilities with Mendelian inheritance. Without other family members, sibling relationships cannot be determined absolutely, but they still can be inferred probabilistically if sufficient genetic marker data are available. In this paper, we describe a simple likelihood ratio method to infer the true relationship of a putative sibling pair. We explore the number of markers required to accurately infer relationships typically encountered in a sib-pair study, as a function of marker allele frequencies, marker spacing, and genotyping error rate, and we conclude that very accurate inference of relationships can be achieved, given the marker data from even part of a genome scan. We compare our method to related methods of relationship inference that have been suggested. Finally, we demonstrate the value of excluding non-full sibs in a genetic linkage study of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.},

To help mitigate this problem, we review and synthesize the theoretical literature on TMIs and, in particular, on trait-mediated indirect interactions, TMIIs, in which the presence of one species mediates the interaction between a second and third species. (1) In models, TMIs tend to stabilize simple communities; adding further biological detail often reduces stability in models, but populations may persist even if their dynamics become mathematically unstable. (2) Short- and long-term changes in population density caused by TMIs depend even more on details, such as the curvature of functional responses and trade-offs, which have rarely been measured. (3) The effects of TMIs in multipredator communities depend in a straightforward way on the specificity of prey defenses. (4) Tritrophic and more complex communities are theoretically difficult; few general conclusions have emerged. Theory needs new kinds of experiments as a guide. The most critical needs are experiments that measure curvatures of trade-offs and responses, and experiments that (combined with theory) allow us to scale from short- to long-term responses of communities. Anecdotal evidence from long-term and large-scale studies suggests that TMIs may affect community dynamics at practical management scales; community models incorporating TMIs are necessary and require closer collaborations between theory and experiment.},

Virtually every genetic data set includes some erroneous genotypes, but genotyping errors remain a taboo subject in population genetics, even though they might greatly bias the final conclusions, especially for studies based on individual identification. Here, we consider four case studies representing a large variety of population genetics investigations differing in their sampling strategies (noninvasive or traditional), in the type of organism studied (plant or animal) and the molecular markers used [microsatellites or amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs)]. In these data sets, the estimated genotyping error rate ranges from 0.8% for microsatellite loci from bear tissues to 2.6% for AFLP loci from dwarf birch leaves. Main sources of errors were allelic dropouts for microsatellites and differences in peak intensities for AFLPs, but in both cases human factors were non-negligible error generators. Therefore, tracking genotyping errors and identifying their causes are necessary to clean up the data sets and validate the final results according to the precision required. In addition, we propose the outline of a protocol designed to limit and quantify genotyping errors at each step of the genotyping process. In particular, we recommend (i) several efficient precautions to prevent contaminations and technical artefacts; (ii) systematic use of blind samples and automation; (iii) experience and rigor for laboratory work and scoring; and (iv) systematic reporting of the error rate in population genetics studies.},

Depending on the traits, the larger heritabilities in this population were due to either larger coefficients of genetic variances or smaller coefficients of environmental variances. Whereas genetic and phenotypic correlation matrices were very similar within each population, they were quite different between populations. In particular, although a positive correlation between age and size at maturity was found in both populations, the correlation between age at maturity and reproductive success was negative in the more variable population (late flowering plant, with a larger size at flowering, produced fewer pods), whereas no correlation was observed in the less variable population. We suggest that while in the less variable population all individuals have a high reproductive effort, several strategies coexist in the more variable population, with some early- flowering genotypes showing a high reproductive effort and other late-flowering genotypes showing a larger competitive ability through increased vegetative growth.},

Evolutionary theories predict that ageing or longevity evolves in response to patterns of extrinsic mortality or intrinsic damage. If ageing is viewed as the outcome of the processes of behaviour, growth and reproduction then it should be possible to predict mortality rate. Recent developments have shown that it is now possible to integrate these ecological and physiological processes and predict the shape of mortality trajectories. By drawing on the key exciting developments in the cellular, physiological and ecological process of longevity the evolutionary consequences of ageing are reviewed. In presenting these ideas an evolutionary demographic framework is used to argue how trade-offs in life-history strategies are important in the maintenance of variation in longevity within and between species. Evolutionary processes associated with longevity have an important role in explaining levels of biological diversity and speciation. In particular, the effects of life-history trait trade-offs in maintaining and promoting species diversity are explored. Such trade-offs can alleviate the effects of intense competition between species and promote species coexistence and diversification. These results have important implications for understanding a number of core ecological processes such as how species are divided among niches, how closely related species co-occur and the rules by which species assemble into food-webs. Theoretical work reveals that the proximate physiological processes are as important as the ecological factors in explaining the variation in the evolution of longevity. Possible future research challenges integrating work on the evolution and mechanisms of growing old are briefly discussed.},

Females may choose brightly coloured males for mating because colour is a reliable signal of a male's genetic resistance to parasites, or that he can bear the cost of the immunosuppressant effects of androgens. Bright yellows, oranges and reds are the product of carotenoid pigments, which are known to have significant health benefits. Therefore, bright colours may be indicative of a bird's quality because it shows access to a superior diet or superior foraging ability. We maintained populations of American kestrels and loggerhead shrikes in captivity that were largely free of parasites and fed a uniform diet. Male kestrels were more brightly coloured than females in the colour of their ceres, lores and legs, and there were pronounced age- and gender- specific patterns to concentrations of carotenoids in their plasma. Even though shrikes do not show any carotenoid-based colouration, the sexes had pronounced differences in plasma carotenoids. Carotenoids in kestrels were unrelated to androgen levels, but the correlation between carotenoids and plasma proteins suggest colour may be a condition-dependent trait. These results suggest that neglected physiological processes may regulate carotenoids, and hence some colour variation need not be explained by parasites, androgens or diet.},

Carotenoid-dependent coloration may have evolved as a signal to conspecifics; however, factors that may limit availability of carotenoids are poorly known. We investigated how the acquisition of carotenoids may be constrained by availability in the environment, diet, genetic make-up and health status of wild American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Plasma concentrations of siblings at the time of fledging showed a high degree of resemblance; however, a cross-fostering experiment revealed that variance was largely explained by nest of rearing, rather than nest of origin, thus indicating a low genetic component. A multivariate analysis of attributes of nestlings (sex, size, plasma proteins, immune function), parental reproduction (laying date, clutch size) and rearing conditions (brood size, size hierarchy nestling mortality) showed only a small significant effect of leucocyte differentials on carotenoid concentrations of nestlings. A strong environmental effect on plasma carotenoids was demonstrated by levels of adult kestrels being correlated within mated pairs, and having a significant association with the abundance of voles, the primary prey species, per territory.},

However, factors determining the absorption of carotenoids and their allocation to different functions are numerous and complex, and causal relationships are generally poorly known. Our objective was to determine the degree to which carotenoid levels in egg yolks and the plasma of hens were influenced by differences in diet and reproductive output in captive red-legged partridges. Carotenoid concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography in two feeds (high and low carotenoid content) and in yolks and plasma of hens near the start and end of laying. Early in the laying season, plasma and yolk carotenoids varied with diet and were correlated with one another. Late in the season, a dietary effect was evident only for yolks, and there was no relationship between plasma and egg levels of individual hens. However, plasma carotenoids at the end of laying were strongly correlated with the number of eggs that had been laid. Dietary availability, although important, could explain some variation in carotenoid levels in plasma and egg yolks only in the context of reproductive history.},

   Abstract = {Species differ enormously in their territorial systems. Some species defend only small areas surrounded by undefended space, while others defend large contiguous territories. Using an optimization approach, we show that this variation can be explained from the density of two types of resources: divisible and nondivisible. We assume that benefits of territories are monotonously related to the defended amount of divisible resources (hereafter called food). In contrast, no benefits are obtained without a nondivisible resource (hereafter called nest site) in the territory, while more than one nest site does not further increase the benefits. The optimal territory size depends on the relative abundance of these resources. With a low density of nest sites, the optimal territory size is small and includes only the nest site. If the density of nest sites is relatively large, the optimal territory size is high, and territories are contiguous. Competition for these different resources yields contrasting patterns of how populations are regulated. If there is mainly competition for nest sites, we expect density-dependent exclusion through territoriality and no density-dependent reproduction. When competition is mainly for food, we expect density-dependent reproduction because optimal territory size will be compressed at higher densities, resulting in lower reproductive success. These predicted patterns indeed are observed in some well-studied passerine species for which both the territorial system and the occurrence of density dependence is known.},

We found that nestling body mass and size did not differ between heat-treated 'parasite-free' nests and heavily infested control nests, However, after controlling for potential confounding variables (laydate, clutch size, chick age, year), we found that broods of heavily infested control nests were more frequently visited and fed than broods that received antiparasite treatment.

Modern teleosts, reptiles and birds have genera that possess rods and four spectral classes of cone each representing one of the five visual pigment families. The complement of four spectrally distinct cone classes endows these species with the potential for tetrachromatic colour vision. In contrast, probably because of their nocturnal ancestry, mammals have rod-dominated retinas with colour vision reduced to a basic dichromatic system subserved by only two spectral classes of cone. It is only within primates, about 35 millions years ago, that mammals 're- evolved' a higher level of colour vision: trichromacy. This was achieved by a gene duplication within the longer-wave cone class to produce two spectrally distinct members of the same visual pigment family which, in conjunction with a short- wavelength pigment, provide the three spectral classes of cone necessary to subserve trichromacy.},

   Abstract = {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated errors, shrinkage estimation, and smoothing of regression relationships may be encompassed within the framework of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Given an unobserved vector of random effects, observations are assumed to be conditionally independent with means that depend on the linear predictor through a specified link function and conditional variances that are specified by a variance function, known prior weights and a scale factor. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance components. For problems involving time series, spatial aggregation and smoothing, the dispersion may be specified in terms of a rank deficient inverse covariance matrix. Approximation of the marginal quasi-likelihood using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the mean parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances. Implementation involves repeated calls to normal theory procedures for REML estimation in variance components problems. By means of informal mathematical arguments, simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on parameters and realizations of random effects in the hierarchical model. The applications cover overdispersion in binomial proportions of seed germination: longitudinal analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients; smoothing of birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort effects in a case-control study of childhood cancer and obstetric radiation; spatial aggregation of lip cancer rates in Scottish counties; and the success of salamander matings in a complicated experiment involving crossing of male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate somewhat the variance components and (in absolute value) fixed effects when applied to clustered binary data, but the situation improves rapidly for binomial observations having denominators greater than one.},

Numerical studies of a series of matched pairs of binary outcomes show that the first order estimators of the variance component are seriously biased. Easily computed correction factors produce satisfactory estimators of small variance components, comparable to those obtained with a second order Laplace expansion, and markedly improve the asymptotic performance for larger values. For a series of matched pairs of binomial observations, the variance correction factors rapidly approach one as the binomial denominators increase. These results greatly extend the range of parameter values for which the approximate estimation procedures have satisfactory asymptotic properties.},

The characters studied include color pattern and antipredator behaviors that interact to facilitate escape from predators. Significant heritabilities for all traits were detected in both populations. Genetic correlations and covariances were found among behaviors in both populations and between color pattern and behavior in one of the populations.

Despite previous evidence suggesting that gene flow prevents local adaptation at the northern range limits of a species expanding northward, we found that great tits differ in their reaction norm to winter conditions according to the population of origin.},

Variation in laying date was best explained by local temperature, and individual females differed in both the elevation and the slope of their laying date-temperature reaction norms. As revealed by animal model analyses, there was weak evidence for additive genetic variance of elevation (h(2) +/- SE = 0.09 +/- 0.09), whereas there was no evidence for heritability of slope (h(2) +/- SE = 0.00 +/- 0.01). Selection analysis, using a female's lifetime production of fledglings or recruits as an estimate of her fitness, revealed significant selection for a lower phenotypic value and breeding value for elevation (i.e., earlier laying date at the average temperature). There was selection for steeper phenotypic values of slope (i.e., greater plasticity in the adjustment of laying date to temperature), but no significant selection on the breeding values of slope. Although these results suggest that phenotypic laying date is influenced by additive genetic factors, as well as by an interaction with the environment, selection on plasticity would not produce an evolutionary response.},

The offspring of attractive males may have enhanced growth(3-5), fecundity(3,4), viability(5-8) or attractiveness(4,9-11). However, the extent to which attractive males bear genes that reduce other fitness components has remained unexplored. Here I show that sexual attractiveness in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) is heritable and genetically correlated with ornamentation. Like ornamentation(12-14), attractiveness may be substantially Y-linked. The benefit of mating with attractive males, and thus having attractive sons, is opposed by strong negative genetic correlation between attractiveness and both offspring survival and the number of sons maturing. Such correlations suggest either antagonistic pleiotropy between attractiveness and survival or linkage disequilibrium between attractive and deleterious alleles. The presence of many colour pattern genes on or near the nonrecombining section of the Y chromosome may facilitate the accumulation of deleterious mutations by genetic hitchhiking(15,16). These findings show that genes enhancing sexual attractiveness may be associated with pleiotropic costs or heavy mutational loads.},

Predicting the outcome of sexual selection on such complex phenotypes requires an understanding of both the direct operation of selection on each trait and the indirect co,consequences of selection operating directly on genetically correlated traits. Here we report the results of a quantitative genetic analysis of the ornamentation, sexual attractiveness, and mating success of male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We analyze male ornamentation both from the point of view of single ornamental traits (e.g., the area of each color) and of composite measures of the way the entire pattern is likely to be perceived by females (e.g., the mean and contrast in chroma). We demonstrate that there is substantial additive genetic variation in almost all measures of male ornamentation and that much of this variation may be Y linked. Attractiveness and mating success are positively correlated at the phenotypic and genetic level. Orange area and chroma, the area of a male's tail, and the color contrast of his pattern overall are positively correlated with attractiveness and/or mating success at the phenotypic and genetic levels. Using attractiveness and mating success as measures of fitness, we estimate gradients of linear directional sexual selection operating on each male trait and use equations of multivariate evolutionary change to predict the response of male ornamentation to this sexual selection. From these analyses, we predict that indirect selection may have important effects on the evolution of male guppy color patterns.},

We show that there is significant repeatable variation in both components of choosiness and in some preference functions but not in others. There appear to be several male ornaments that females find uniformly attractive and others for which females differ in preference. One consequence is that there is no universally attractive male phenotype. Only responsiveness shows significant additive genetic variation. Variation in responsiveness appears to mask variation in discrimination and some preference functions and may be the most biologically relevant source of phenotypic and genetic variation in mate- choice behavior. To test the potential evolutionary importance of the phenotypic variation in mate choice that we report, we estimated the opportunity for and the intensity of sexual selection under models of mate choice that excluded and that incorporated individual female variation. We then compared these estimates with estimates based on measured mating success. Incorporating individual variation in mate choice generally did not predict the outcome of sexual selection any better than models that ignored such variation.},

   Abstract = {Stabilizing selection is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology. In the presence of a single intermediate optimum phenotype (fitness peak) on the fitness surface, stabilizing selection should cause the population to evolve toward such a peak. This prediction has seldom been tested, particularly for suites of correlated traits. The lack of tests for an evolutionary match between population means and adaptive peaks may be due, at least in part, to problems associated with empirically detecting multivariate stabilizing selection and with testing whether population means are at the peak of multivariate fitness surfaces. Here we show how canonical analysis of the fitness surface, combined with the estimation of confidence regions for stationary points on quadratic response surfaces, may be used to define multivariate stabilizing selection on a suite of traits and to establish whether natural populations reside on the multivariate peak. We manufactured artificial advertisement calls of the male cricket Teleogryllus commodus and played them back to females in laboratory phonotaxis trials to estimate the linear and nonlinear sexual selection that female phonotactic choice imposes on male call structure. Significant nonlinear selection on the major axes of the fitness surface was convex in nature and displayed an intermediate optimum, indicating multivariate stabilizing selection. The mean phenotypes of four independent samples of males, from the same population as the females used in phonotaxis trials, were within the 95% confidence region for the fitness peak. These experiments indicate that stabilizing sexual selection may play an important role in the evolution of male call properties in natural populations of T. commodus.},

   Abstract = {Genetic improvement of dairy cows, which has increased the milk yield of cows in the UK by 1200 kg per lactation in 12 years, is an excellent example of the application of quantitative genetics to agriculture. The most important traits of dairy cattle are expressed only in females, but the main opportunity for selection is in males. Despite this, genetic improvement was achieved by the invention of a new statistical methodology, called 'best linear unbiased prediction' to estimate the breeding value of bulls. Intense selection of the best bulls, combined with the worldwide use of these bulls through artificial insemination and frozen semen, has created a global population and caused concern that the genetic variation available in the future will be reduced. Maintenance of genetic variation and long-term genetic gains would be aided by rational payment systems, use of crossbreeding where profitable, inclusion of all economically important traits in the breeding objective, recognition of genotype by environment interactions and the use of selection algorithms that balance estimated breeding value against the average relationship among the selected animals. Fortunately, all of these things are happening to some degree.},

   Abstract = {1. Variation in survival, a major determinant of fitness, may be caused by individual or environmental characteristics. Furthermore, interactions between individuals may influence survival through the negative feedback effects of density dependence. Compared to species in temperate regions, we have little knowledge about population processes and variation in fitness in tropical bird species. 2. To investigate whether variation in survival could be explained by population size or climatic variables we used capture-recapture models in conjunction with a long-term data set from an island population of the territorial, cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). The lack of migration out of the study population means that our results are not confounded by dispersal. 3. Annual survival was high, both for adults (84%) and juveniles (61%), and did not differ between the sexes. Although there was significant variation in survival between years, this variation could not be explained by overall population size or weather variables. 4. For territorial species, resource competition will work mainly on a local scale. The size of a territory and number of individuals living in it will therefore be a more appropriate measure of density than overall population density. Consequently, both an index of territory quality per individual (food availability) and local density, measured as group size, were included as individual covariates in our analyses. 5. Local density had a negative effect on survival; birds living in larger groups had lower survival probabilities than those living in small groups. Food availability did not affect survival. 6. Our study shows that, in a territorial species, although density-dependent effects might not be detectable at the population level they can be detected at the individual territory level - the scale at which individuals compete. These results will help to provide a better understanding of the small-scale processes involved in the dynamics of a population in general, but in particular in tropical species living in relatively stable environments.},

The genetic relationships between them are reviewed in fishes and several mammalian species. We have focused especially on mice where data are most abundant. In mice, many individual genes influencing these traits have been identified, and numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) located. The extensive data on both unselected and selected mouse populations, with some characterized for more than 100 generations, allow a thorough investigation of the dynamics of this relationship during the process of selection. Although there is a substantial positive genetic correlation between both traits in unselected populations, caused mainly by the high correlation between BW and ovulation rate, that correlation apparently declines during selection and therefore does not restrict a relatively independent development of both traits. The importance of these findings for overall reproductive fitness and its change during selection is discussed.},

   Abstract = {Mating system and effective pollen dispersal were studied in a natural stand of knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata Lemmon.) using 11 isozyme loci. Analyses were performed by fitting neighbourhood and mixed-mating models to multilocus genotypic arrays of-offspring from four mother trees. Neighbourhoods consisted of all potential outcross males within 11 m of each mother tree (44, on average). Average outcrossing rates of the mother trees were estimated to be 0.97 and 0.96 for the respective models, whereas the population-wide outcrossing rate based on the mixed-mating model and a broader sample of mother trees was 0.92. The estimated proportion of offspring sired by males outside the neighbourhood of each mother tree was 0.56. Thus about 41 per cent of matings resulted from outcrossing with nearby males (within neighbourhoods). Distance and direction of individual males from mother trees and the size (tree height) of males played significant roles in determining outcross mating patterns within neighbourhoods. Male mating success increased with both proximity and tree size, although males east of mother trees accounted for more offspring than males in other directions. Despite the role of proximity, directionality and tree size in determining mating success within neighbourhoods, the effective number of males mating with each female seems to be large.},

Formerly the model was applied only to haploid pollen gametes in the offspring of conifers, but is extended so that it can be used with genotypic data from diploid offspring of both angiosperms and gymnosperms. In addition, it is shown that the mating parameters can be estimated without independent estimates of allele frequencies in the pollen pools outside the neighbourhood; thus the model might be applied effectively to natural populations exposed to unknown external pollen sources. Parameters of the neighbourhood mating model were estimated for a 10-year-old seed orchard population of the insect-pollinated tree, Eucalyptus regnans, in southeast Australia, which contained a mixture of two geographical provenances (Victoria and Tasmania). The mating patterns revealed were complex. Crosses between trees of the same provenance occurred three times more often than crosses between trees of different provenances. Levels of self-fertilization and patterns of mating within neighbourhoods were influenced by provenance origin, crop fecundity and orchard position (central vs. edge) of mother trees. Gene dispersal, however, was extensive, with approximately 50% of effective pollen gametes coming from males more than 40 m away from mother trees (average distance between neighbouring trees was 7.4 m). Thus, insect pollinators are efficient promoters of cross-fertilization in this orchard, with the result that the effective number of males mating with each female is large.},

   Abstract = {The brown long-eared bat, Plecotus auritus, is unusual among temperate zone bats in that summer maternity colonies are composed of adult males and females, with both sexes displaying natal philopatry and long-term association with a colony. Here, we describe the use of microsatellite analysis to investigate colony relatedness and mating patterns, with the aim of identifying the evolutionary determinants of social organization in P. auritus. Mean colony relatedness was found to be low (R = 0.033 +/- 0.002), with pairwise estimates of R within colonies ranging from -0.4 to 0.9. The proportion of young fathered by males in their own colony was investigated using a Bayesian approach, incorporating parameters detailing the number of untyped individuals. This analysis revealed that most offspring were fathered by males originating from a different colony to their own. In addition, we determined that the number of paternal half-sibs among cohorts of young was low, inferring little or no skew in male reproductive success. The results of this study suggest that kin selection cannot account for colony stability and natal philopatry in P. auritus, which may instead be explained by advantages accrued through the use of familiar and successful roost sites, and through long-term associations with conspecifics. Moreover, because the underlying causes of male natal dispersal in mammals, such as risk of inbreeding or competition for mates, appear to be avoided via extra-colony copulation and low male reproductive skew, both P. auritus males and females are able to benefit from long-term association with the natal colony.},

Elementwise threshold crossing then gives the observed vector of binary outcomes. Special cases of this model include recently discussed mixed logistic regression and probit models, which have had either parametric (usually Gaussian) or nonparametric mixing distributions. me give sufficient conditions for identifiability of the mixing distribution and fixed effects and for convergence of maximum likelihood estimators for the mixing distribution and fixed effects. As expected, the conditions are much stronger for nonparametric mixing than for Gaussian mixing. We illustrate the conditions by applying them to a practical example.},

   Abstract = {A growing body of evidence indicates that phenotypic selection on juvenile traits of both plants and animals may be considerable. Because juvenile traits are typically subject to maternal effects and often have low heritabilities, adaptive responses to natural selection on these traits may seem unlikely. To determine the potential for evolutionary response to selection on juvenile traits of Nemophila menziesii (Hydrophyllaceae), we conducted two quantitative genetic studies. A reciprocal factorial cross, involving 16 parents and 1960 progeny, demonstrated a significant maternal component of variance in seed mass and additive genetic component of variance in germination time. This experiment also suggested that interaction between parents, though small, provides highly significant contributions to the variance of both traits. Such a parental interaction could arise by diverse mechanisms, including dependence of nuclear gene expression on cytoplasmic genotype, but the design of this experiment could not distinguish this from other possible causes, such as effects on progeny phenotype of interaction between the environmental conditions of both parents. The second experiment, spanning three generations with over 11,000 observations, was designed for investigation of the additive genetic variance in maternal effect, assessment of paternal effects, as well as further partitioning of the parental interaction identified in the reciprocal factorial experiment. It yielded no consistent evidence of paternal effects on seed mass, nor of parental interactions. Our inference of such interaction effects from the first experiment was evidently an artifact of failing to account for the substantial variance among fruits within crosses. The maternal effect was found to have a large additive genetic component, accounting for at least 20% of the variation in individual seed mass. This result suggests that there is appreciable potential for response to selection on seed mass through evolution of the maternal effect. We discuss aspects that may nevertheless limit response to individual selection on seed mass, including trade-offs between the size of individual seeds and germination time and between the number of seeds a maternal plant can mature and their mean size.},

Females preferred experimentally improved territories but still chose high- quality sires for their progeny. High-quality territories were associated with earlier egg-laying dates and larger eggs. These maternal effects, evidently stimulated by high-quality territories, have been shown to enhance competitive ability and therefore the likelihood that philopatric offspring will capitalize on the direct benefits of superior territories, previously shown to promote progeny growth rate and survival (most offspring do not disperse from their natal area). Paternity analysis within clutches co-sired by two males revealed that female preferences for large males were also adaptive in terms of indirect benefits. Females used sperm from large sires to produce sons and sperm from small sires to produce daughters. Differential allocation of resources and progeny sex was adaptive and demonstrates a high degree of female control in the mating system.},

   Abstract = {Genetic potential for evolutionary change and covariational constraints are typically summarized as the genetic variance- covariance matrix G, and there is currently debate over the extent to which G remains effectively constant during the course of adaptive evolution. However, G provides only a temporally restricted view of constraints that ignores possible biases in how new mutations affect multivariate phenotypes. We used chemical mutagenesis to study the effect of mutations as summarized by the mutational covariance matrix, M, in Arabidopsis thaliana. By introducing mutations into three isogenic strains of A. thaliana, we were able to quantify M directly as the genetic variance-covariance matrix of mutagenized lines. Induced mutations generally did not alter the means of the six morphology and life-history traits we measured, but they did affect the levels of available genetic variation and the covariances among traits. However, these effects were not consistent among the three isogenic lines; that is, there were significant differences among the lines in both the number of mutations produced by ethyl-methane- sulfonate treatment and the M matrices they induced. The evolutionary implications of the dependence of M on the number of mutations, the particular genetic background, and the mutagenic sampling of loci in the genome are discussed in light of commonly applied models of multivariate evolution and the potential for the genetic architecture itself to change in ways that facilitate the coordinated evolution of complex phenotypes.},

   Abstract = {An increasing number of studies find females to base their mate choice on several cues. Why this occurs is debated and many different hypotheses have been proposed. Here I review the hypotheses and the evidence in favour of them. At the same time I provide a new categorisation based on the adaptiveness of the preferences and the information content of the cues. A few comparative and empirical studies suggest that most multiple cues are Fisherian attractiveness cues or uninformative cues that occur alongside a viability indicator and facilitate detection, improve signal reception, or are remnants from past selection pressures. However, much evidence exists for multiple cues providing additional information and serving as multiple messages that either indicate general mate quality or enable females that differ in mate preferences to choose the most suitable male. Less evidence exists for multiple cues serving as back-up signals. The importance of receiver psychology, multiple sensory environments and signal interaction in the evolution of multiple cues and preferences has received surprisingly little attention but may be of crucial importance. Similarly, sexual conflict has been proposed to result in maladaptive preferences for manipulative cues, and in neutral preferences for threshold cues, but no reliable evidence exists so far. An important factor in the evolution of multiple preferences is the cost of using additional cues. Most theoretical work assumes that the cost of choice increases with the number of cues used, which restricts the conditions under which preferences for multiple cues are expected to evolve. I suggest that in contrast to this expectation, the use of multiple cues can reduce mate choice costs by decreasing the number of mates inspected more closely or the time and energy spent inspecting a set of mates. This may be one explanation for why multiple cues are more common than usually expected. Finally I discuss the consequences that the use of multiple cues may have for the process of sexual selection, the maintenance of genetic variation, and speciation.},

We investigated possible evolutionary divergence and environmental influences on G using data from a factorial common-garden experiment where common frog (Rana temporaria) tadpoles from two divergent populations were exposed to three different environmental treatments. G-matrices were estimated using an animal model approach applied to data from a NCII breeding design. Matrix comparisons using both Flury and multivariate analysis of variance methods revealed significant differences in G matrices both between populations and between treatments within populations, the former being generally larger than the latter. Comparison of levels of population differentiation in trait means using Q(ST) indices with that observed in microsatellite markers (F-ST) revealed that the former values generally exceeded the neutral expectation set by F-ST. Hence, the results suggest that intraspecific divergence in G matrix structure has occurred mainly due to natural selection.},

A single-trait animal model was used to generate the data and to predict breeding values. The data originated from 10 sires and 100 dams and simulation progressed for 10 overlapping generations. In simulating the data, genetic evaluation used the underlying parameter values and sires and dams were chosen by truncation selection for greatest predicted breeding values. Four alternative pedigree structures were evaluated: complete pedigree information, 50% of phenotypes with sire identities missing, 50% of phenotypes with dam identities missing, and 50% of phenotypes with sire and dams identities missing. Under selection and with complete pedigree data, Method R was a slightly less consistent estimator of h(2) than REML. Estimates of h(2) by both methods were biased downward when there was selection and loss of pedigree information and were unbiased when no selection was practiced. The empirical mean square error (EMSE) of Method R was several times larger than the EMSE of REML. In a subsequent analysis, different combinations of generations selected and generations sampled were simulated in an effort to disentangle the effects of both factors on Method R estimates of h(2). It was observed that Method R overestimated h(2) when both the sampling that is intrinsic in the method and the selection occurred in generations 6 to 10. In a final experiment, BLUP(a) were predicted with h(2) estimated by either Method R or REML. Subsequently, five more generations of selection were practiced, and the mean square error of prediction (MSEP) of BLUP(a) was calculated with estimated h(2) by either method, or the true value of the parameter. The MSEP of empirical BLUP(a) using Method R was greater than the MSEP of empirical BLUP(a) using REML. The latter statistic was closer to prediction error variance of BLUP(a) than the MSEP of empirical BLUP(a) using Method R, indicating that empirical BLUP(a) calculated using REML produced accurate predictions of breeding values under selection. In conclusion, the variability of h(2) estimates calculated with Method R was greater than the variability of h(2) estimates calculated with REML, with or without selection. Also, the MSEP of EBLUP(a) calculated using estimates of h(2) by Method R was larger than MSEP of EBLUP(a) calculated with REML estimates of h(2).},

   Abstract = {Quantitative traits are shaped by networks of pleiotropic genes [1]. To understand the mechanisms that maintain genetic variation for quantitative traits in natural populations and to predict responses to artificial and natural selection, we must evaluate pleiotropic effects of underlying quantitative trait genes and define functional allelic variation at the level of quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs). Catecholamines up (Catsup), which encodes a negative regulator of tyrosine hydroxylase [2], the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine, is a pleiotropic quantitative trait gene in Drosophila melanogaster [2-4]. We used association mapping to determine whether the same or different QTNs at Catsup are associated with naturally occurring variation in multiple quantitative traits. We sequenced 169 Catsup alleles from a single population and detected 33 polymorphisms with little linkage disequilibrium (LD). Different molecular polymorphisms in Catsup are independently associated with variation in longevity, locomotor behavior, and sensory bristle number. Most of these polymorphisms are potentially functional variants in protein coding regions, have large effects, and are not common. Thus, Catsup is a pleiotropic quantitative trait gene, but individual QTNs do not have pleiotropic effects. Molecular population genetic analyses of Catsup sequences are consistent with balancing selection maintaining multiple functional polymorphisms.},

For Australian terrestrial mammals this link is of particular interest because it is widely believed that species in the intermediate size range of 35-5500 g (the "critical weight range") have been the most prone to recent extinction. But the relationship between body size and extinction risk in Australian mammals has never been subject to a robust statistical analysis. Using a combination of randomization tests and phylogenetic comparative analyses, we found that Australian mammal extinctions and declines have been nonrandom with respect to body size, but we reject the hypothesis of a critical weight range at intermediate sizes. Small species appear to be the least prone to extinction, but extinctions have not been significantly clustered around intermediate sizes. Our results suggest that hypotheses linking intermediate body size with high risk of extinction in Australian mammals are misguided and that the focus of future research should shift to explaining why the smallest species are the most resistant to extinction.},

In this paper, data for the Australian terrestrial mammal fauna are used to ask whether higher reproductive output or smaller home ranges can explain the reduced extinction risk of smaller species. Extinct and endangered species do indeed have smaller litters and larger home ranges for their body size than expected under a null model. In multiple regressions, however, only litter size is a significant predictor of extinction risk once body size and phylogeny are controlled for. Larger litters contribute to fast population growth, and are probably part of the reason that smaller species are less extinction-prone. The effect of litter size varies between the mesic coastal regions and the and interior of Australia, indicating that the environment a species inhabits mediates the effect of biology on extinction risk. These results suggest that predicting extinction risk from biological traits is likely to be a complex task which must consider explicitly interactions between biology and environment.},

We compared this model to a model based on the Henderson average numerator relationship (ANRM) in a simulation study with 10 replicated datasets generated for each of two traits. Trait 1 had a medium heritability (h(2)) for each of direct and maternal genetic effects whereas Trait 2 had a high h(2) attributable only to direct effects. The average posterior probabilities inferred on the true sire were between 1 and 10% larger than the corresponding priors (the inverse of the number of candidate sires in a mating pasture) for Trait 1 and between 4 and 13% larger than the corresponding priors for Trait 2. The predicted additive and maternal genetic effects were very similar using both models; however, model choice criteria (Pseudo Bayes Factor and Deviance Information Criterion) decisively favored the proposed hierarchical model over the ANRM model.},

   Pages = {955-973},
   Abstract = {Organisms usually grow slower than their maximum potential under a given set of conditions, suggesting that fast growth carries a corresponding fitness cost. A pattern of growth that might influence such costs is compensatory (or catch-up) growth, where individuals grow faster than expected. One form of compensatory growth occurs when small individuals grow faster for their size than do large individuals, thereby decreasing (or slowing the increase in) size disparity between themselves and larger conspecifics. We tested these ideas over several seasons in wild brown trout (Salmo trutta) by estimating selection acting on individual size, growth and compensatory growth. We then examined population-level growth patterns to determine whether they influence individual-level selection. Selection generally did not favour large individuals or those with slow growth; indeed, the opposite was more likely. Moreover, selection did not act against small/fast-growing individuals (i.e. those expressing compensatory growth). Population-level growth was proportional (i.e. mass increases were a constant percentage of initial mass across the range of body sizes) in all seasons except for the spring and, to a lesser degree, the early summer of the second year of life. In these two intervals, small fish showed greater proportional growth than large fish and small/fast-growing fish had higher (or at least not lower) survival. An intriguing explanation for these results is that fast (and compensatory) growth is only exhibited when the costs of fast growth are lows. Our study introduces a novel approach for assessing growth at the population level, as well as the survival costs associated with individual size and growth.},

Group-living appears to have high reproductive costs for females, and may lead to increased levels of inbreeding. The extent of female competition for reproduction has been estimated from field data, but knowledge of male reproductive success and the extent of extra-group paternity remains limited. Combining field data with genetic data (16 microsatellite loci), we studied the mating system of 10 badger social groups across 14 years in a high-density population. From 923 badgers, including 425 cubs, we were able to assign maternity to 307 cubs, with both parents assigned to 199 cubs (47%) with 80% confidence, and 14% with 95% confidence. Age had a significant effect on the probability of reproduction, seemingly as a result of a deficit of individuals aged two years and greater than eight years attaining parentage. We estimate that approximately 30% of the female population successfully reproduced in any given year, with a similar proportion of the male population gaining paternity across the same area. While it was known there was a cost to female reproduction in high density populations, it appears that males suffer similar, but not greater, costs. Roughly half of assigned paternity was attributed to extra-group males, the majority of which were from neighbouring social groups. Few successful matings occurred between individuals born in the same social group (22%). The high rate of extra-group mating, previously unquantified, may help reduce inbreeding, potentially making philopatry a less costly strategy.},

We determine that the island Blue Tit has a longer tarsometatarsus, larger foot span and a more proximal insertion of the tibialis cranialis muscle (flexor of the tarsometatarsus) than the mainland Blue Tit. These morphological differences are consistent with the more frequent use of hanging and clinging 'head-up' postures by the Iberian Blue Tit. Several ecomorphological hypotheses obtained at the interspecific level with other taxa, have proved to be of high predictive value for explaining ecological differences considering morphological evolution. The Tenerife Blue Tit and the Iberian Coal Tit clearly show close convergence in both feeding postures and leg structure, although some differences in morphology were found between these two species. Convergence in foraging methods between the island Blue Tit and the mainland Coal Tit can be explained without considering current interspecific competition as a determinant of niche space.},

Dispersal out of the study area is modeled separately. Survival and dispersal probabilities are examined for the possible influence of both environmental and individual covariates, including a range of alternative measures of population density.

We demonstrate large differences in the rate of senescence between males and females even though their senescence begins at the same age.

During nine years, we experimentally induced deparasitized broods, whereas unmanipulated control broods remained heavily infested by two species of Protocalliphora ectoparasites. The heritability of tarsus length was significantly higher in deparasitized broods than control broods, due in part to a very low common brood environment effect in deparasitized broods. We also found evidence for significant genotype-by-environment interactions, which further reflected the effect of the ecological conditions on the expression of additive genetic effects and could represent an additional constraint on the evolution of tarsus length. To our knowledge, this experiment provides the first evidence of host quantitative genetics being influenced by parasitism, and illustrates the potential for parasitism to constrain an evolutionary response to selection.},

Chick tarsus length and body mass at fledging showed substantial levels of genetic variation in the three populations. Estimated heritabilities of body mass increased with habitat quality. The poorer habitats showed weak positive selection on tarsus length, and strong positive selection on body mass, but there was no significant selection on either trait in the good habitat.

   Abstract = {Studies of birds have recently played an important role in the increasing success of quantitative genetics applied to natural populations. However, these studies mostly base their pedigree relationships on social information, despite the known widespread genetic polygamy in avian species. Here, we study the influence of misassigned paternities, combined with the effect of pedigree size and depth, on the estimation of heritability. First, we compute simulations of a polygenic trait for two levels of heritability (0.1 and 0.4), several extra-pair paternity rates (ranging from 5% to 40%), and varying sample sizes (20, 50 and 100 broods) or pedigree depth (2 or 4 generations). We compare heritability estimates from the social and the genetic pedigree, running a restricted maximum-likelihood 'animal model'. Social pedigree underestimates heritability by an average of 0-17% for 5-20% extra-pair paternities and by up to 18% for 40% extra-pair paternities and a heritability of 0.4. Second, we identifyied extra-pair offspring using microsatellite loci in two populations of blue tits (Parus caeruleus) showing high levels of extra-pair paternities (15% and 25% of extra-pair offspring). We compare heritabilities of tarsus length and body mass estimated with pedigrees of increasing accuracy. These analyses suggest that the bias induced by misassigned paternities on heritability estimation depends on the level of heritability and the rate of paternity error. Typical rates of extra-pair paternities in birds (around 20% of offspring) should result in an underestimation of heritability of less than 15% when estimated over a minimum of 100 broods.},

   Abstract = {An essential requirement to determine a population's potential for evolutionary change is to quantify the amount of genetic variability expressed for traits under selection. Early investigations in laboratory conditions showed that the magnitude of the genetic and environmental components of phenotypic variation can change with environmental conditions. However, there is no consensus as to how the expression of genetic variation is sensitive to different environmental conditions. Recently, the study of quantitative genetics in the wild has been revitalized by new pedigree analyses based on restricted maximum likelihood, resulting in a number of studies investigating these questions in wild populations. Experimental manipulation of environmental quality in the wild, as well as the use of naturally occurring favourable or stressful environments, has broadened the treatment of different taxa and traits. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis on recent studies comparing heritability in favourable versus unfavourable conditions in non-domestic and non-laboratory animals. The results provide evidence for increased heritability in more favourable conditions, significantly so for morphometric traits but not for traits more closely related to fitness. We discuss how these results are explained by underlying changes in variance components, and how they represent a major step in our understanding of evolutionary processes in wild populations. We also show how these trends contrast with the prevailing view resulting mainly from laboratory experiments on Drosophila. Finally, we underline the importance of taking into account the environmental variation in models predicting quantitative trait evolution.},

   Abstract = {Why do individuals stop reproducing after a certain age, and how is this age determined? The antagonistic pleiotropy theory for the evolution of senescence predicts that increased early-life performance should be accompanied by earlier (or faster) senescence. Hence, an individual that has started to breed early should also lose its reproductive capacities early. We investigate here the relationship between age at first reproduction (AFR) and age at last reproduction (ALR) in a free-ranging mute swan (Cygnus olor) population monitored for 36 years. Using multivariate analyses on the longitudinal data, we show that both traits are strongly selected in opposite directions. Analysis of the phenotypic covariance between these characters shows that individuals vary in their inherent quality, such that some individuals have earlier AFR and later ALR than expected. Quantitative genetic pedigree analyses show that both traits possess additive genetic variance but also that AFR and ALR are positively genetically correlated. Hence, although both traits display heritable variation and are under opposing directional selection, their evolution is constrained by a strong evolutionary tradeoff. These results are consistent with the theory that increased early-life performance comes with faster senescence because of genetic tradeoffs.},

   Abstract = {Life- history traits in wild populations are often regarded as being subject to directional selection, and the existence of substantial variation and microevolutionary stasis of these characters is therefore a problem in need of explanation. Avian clutch size is an archetypal life- history trait in this context, and many studies have sought to test explanations for stasis in clutch size. Surprisingly, there are many fewer studies that used long- term data to ask how selection acts on clutch size, particularly in a multivariate framework. In this article, we report selection, inheritance, and evolution of clutch size over 25 years in a colony of mute swans using a multivariate quantitative genetic framework to control for correlations with breeding time. We show that clutch size is influenced by both additive genetic and permanent environmental effects and that selection acts on clutch size in combination with breeding time. Natural selection on clutch size is strongly directional, favoring larger clutches, and we observe an increase in clutch size of 0.35 standard deviations, consistent with the expected response based on selection and inheritance of clutch size. We hypothesize that these changes result from recent relaxation of food constraints and predation risks experienced by this colony.},

Whether populations show temporal and/or spatial constancy in patterns of genetic variance and covariance is regularly considered, as this will determine whether selection responses are constant over space and time. Much less often considered is whether characters show differing amounts of genetic variance over the life-history of individuals. Such age-specific variation, if present, has important potential consequences for the force of natural selection and for understanding the causes of variation in quantitative characters. Using data from a long-term study of the mute swan Cygnus olor, we report the partitioning of phenotypic variance in timing of breeding (subject to strong natural selection) into component parts over 12 different age classes. We show that the additive genetic variance and heritability of this trait are strongly age-dependent, with higher additive genetic variance present in young and, particularly, old birds, but little evidence of any genetic variance for birds of intermediate ages. These results demonstrate that age can have a very important influence on the components of variation of characters in natural populations, and consequently that separate age classes cannot be assumed to be equivalent, either with respect to their evolutionary potential or response.},

   Abstract = {The evolution of sexual dimorphism may occur when natural and sexual selection result in different optimum trait values for males and females. Perhaps the most prominent examples of sexual dimorphism occur in sexually selected traits, for which males usually display exaggerated trait levels, while females may show reduced expression of the trait. In some species, females also exhibit secondary sexual traits that may either be a consequence of a correlated response to sexual selection on males or direct sexual selection for female secondary sexual traits. In this experiment, we simultaneously measure the intersex genetic correlations and the relative strength of sexual selection on males and females for a set of cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila serrata. There was significant directional sexual selection on both male and female cuticular hydrocarbons: the strength of sexual selection did not differ among the sexes but males and females preferred different cuticular hydrocarbons. In contrast with many previous studies of sexual dimorphism, intersex genetic correlations were low. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in D. serrata appears to have been achieved by sex-limited expression of traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome and is likely to be in its final stages.},

   Pages = {1221-1232},
   Abstract = {Many derivations of effective population sizes have been suggested in the literature; however, few account for the breeding structure and none can readily be expanded to subdivided populations. Breeding structures influence gene correlations through their effects on the number of breeding individuals of each sex, the mean number of progeny per female, and the variance in the number of progeny produced by males and females. Additionally, hierarchical structuring in a population is determined by the number of breeding groups and the migration rates of males and females among such groups. This study derives analytical solutions for effective sizes that can be applied to subdivided populations. Parameters that encapsulate breeding structure and subdivision are utilized to derive the traditional inbreeding and variance effective sizes. Also, it is shown that effective sizes can be determined for any hierarchical level of population structure for which gene correlations can accrue. Derivations of effective sizes for the accumulation of gene correlations within breeding groups (coancestral effective size) and among breeding groups (intergroup effective size) are given. The results converge to traditional, single population measures when similar assumptions are applied. In particular, inbreeding and intergroup effective sizes are shown to be special cases of the coancestral effective size, and intergroup and variance effective sizes will be equal if the population census remains constant. Instantaneous solutions for effective sizes, at any time after gene correlation begins to accrue, are given in terms of traditional F statistics or transition equations. All effective sizes are shown to converge upon a common asymptotic value when breeding tactics and migration rates are constant. The asymptotic effective size can be expressed in terms of the fixation indices and the number of breeding groups; however, the rate of approach to the asymptote is dependent upon dispersal rates. For accurate assessment of effective sizes, initial, instantaneous or asymptotic, the expressions must be applied at the lowest levels at which migration among breeding groups is nonrandom. Thus, the expressions may be applicable to lineages within socially structured populations, fragmented populations (if random exchange of genes prevails within each population), or combinations of intra- and interpopulation discontinuities of gene flow. Failure to recognize internal structures of populations may lead to considerable overestimates of inbreeding effective size, while usually underestimating variance effective size.},

The evolution of sexual dimorphism by sex-limited gene expression alleviates this problem. However, because the majority of genes are not sex-limited, the potential for substantial conflict may remain. Here we assess the degree of ontogenetic conflict in the fruit- fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by cloning 40 haploid genomes and measuring their Darwinian fitness in both sexes. The intersexual genetic correlations for juvenile viability, adult reproductive success, and total fitness were used to gauge potential conflict during development. First, as juveniles, where the fitness objectives of the two sexes appear to be similar, survival was strongly positively correlated across sexes. second, after adult maturation, where gender roles diverge, a significant negative correlation for reproductive success was found. Finally, because of counterbalancing correlations in the juvenile and adult components, no intersexual correlation for total fitness was found. Highly significant genotype-by-gender interaction variance was measured for both adult and total fitness. These results demonstrate strong intersexual discord during development because of the expression of sexually antagonistic variation.},

Thus, it may also be regarded as a general representation of colour opponent relations, linking graphically the Young-Helmholtz theory of trichromacy and Hering's concept of opponent colours. It is shown on a geometrical basis that chromaticity can be coded unequivocally by any two combined spectrally opponent mechanisms, the main difference between particular mechanisms being the extension and compression of certain spectral areas.

   Abstract = {We tested the effect of manipulation of breeding density on the occurrence of extra-pair paternity in a blue tit (Parus caeruleus) population during two consecutive years. In a homogeneous oak forest, nest-box manipulation provided a high density plot (plot A, 1.10 and 1.32 pairs/ha) and a low density plot (plot B, 0.43 and 0.46 pairs/ha). Microsatellite analysis on 91 broods revealed a higher proportion of extra-pair paternity in broods in plot A (mean of 17.2%) than in plot B (mean of 11.4%). A correlative approach showed that the proportion of extra-pair young in broods was affected by the number of breeding neighbours within 100 m around the nest-box, by the distance to the nearest breeding neighbour and by an additional plot effect. However, the nearest neighbours accounted for only 39.3% of extra-pair paternities and distance to extra-pair fathers was significantly higher than the nearest neighbour distance in both plots. This implies that the effect of density on the occurrence of extra-pair paternities is associated with active female choice to enhance the brood fitness. Although there were more extra-pair young in broods when density was high, the number of extra-pair fathers did not increase and stayed close to one. We suggest that density increases the cost of mate guarding by males, thereby increasing the possibility for females to solicit extra-pair paternities to the cuckolding male they have chosen. Finally, we discuss why correlatives approaches do not always show evidence for an effect of breeding density on extra-pair paternity occurrence.},

   Abstract = {Directional selection for parasite resistance is often intense in highly social host species. Using a partial cross-fostering experiment we studied environmental and genetic variation in immune response and morphology in a highly colonial bird species, the house martin (Delichon urbica). We manipulated intensity of infestation of house martin nests by the haematophagous parasitic house martin bug Oeciacus hirundinis either by spraying nests with a weak pesticide or by inoculating them with 50 bugs. Parasitism significantly affected tarsus length, T cell response, immunoglobulin and leucocyte concentrations. We found evidence of strong environmental effects on nestling body mass, body condition, wing length and tarsus length, and evidence of significant additive genetic variance for wing length and haematocrit. We found significant environmental variance, but no significant additive genetic variance in immune response parameters such as T cell response to the antigenic phytohemagglutinin, immunoglobulins, and relative and absolute numbers of leucocytes. Environmental variances were generally greater than additive genetic variances, and the low heritabilities of phenotypic traits were mainly a consequence of large environmental variances and small additive genetic variances. Hence, highly social bird species such as the house martin, which are subject to intense selection by parasites, have a limited scope for immediate microevolutionary response to selection because of low heritabilities, but also a limited scope for long-term response to selection because evolvability as indicated by small additive genetic coefficients of variation is weak.},

   Abstract = {Population sample data are complex; inference and prediction require proper accommodation of not only the nonlinear interactions that determine the expected future abundance, but also the stochasticity inherent in data and variable (often unobserved) environmental factors. Moreover, censuses may occur sporadically, and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records, hunting reports, or fossil/archeological surveys). We extend the basic state-space model for time-series analysis to accommodate these dominant sources of variability that influence population data. Using examples, we show how different types of process error and observation error, unequal sample intervals, and missing values can be accounted for within the flexible framework of Bayesian state-space models. We provide algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can be used to obtain posterior estimates of population states and of model parameters. For models that can be linearized, results can be used for direct sampling of the posterior, including those with missing values and unequal sample intervals. For nonlinear models, we make use of Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs sampling framework. Examples derive from long-term census and population data. We illustrate the extension to discrete state variables with multiple stages using a Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model for mid 20th-century measles infection in London, where birth rates are assumed known, but susceptibles and infected individuals arise from imperfect reporting.},

Results showed that omission of one of the random effects leads to an incorrect decomposition of the other components. If maternal genetic effects exist but are neglected, direct heritability is overestimated, and sometimes more than double. The bias depends on the value of the genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects. To study the influence of data structure on the estimation of genetic parameters, several populations were simulated, with different degrees of known paternity and different levels of genetic connectedness between flocks. Results showed that the lack of connectedness affects estimates when flocks have different genetic means because no distinction can be made between genetic and environmental differences between flocks. In this case, direct and maternal heritabilities are under-estimated, whereas maternal environmental effects are overestimated. The insufficiency of pedigree leads to biased estimates of genetic parameters.},

Although the evolution of cooperative breeding has often been,attributed primarily to kin selection (whereby individuals gain "indirect" benefits to their fitness by assisting collateral relatives), there is increasing evidence that helpers can be unrelated to the young they are raising. Recent studies also suggest that the indirect benefits of cooperative behavior may often have been overestimated while the direct benefits of helping to the helper's own fitness have probably been underestimated. It now seems likely that the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining cooperative breeding are diverse and that, in some species, the direct benefits of helping may be sufficient to maintain cooperative societies. The benefits of cooperation in vertebrate societies may consequently show parallels with those in human societies, where cooperation between unrelated individuals is frequent and social institutions are often maintained by generalized reciprocity.},

   Abstract = {Complexity in male sexual displays is widely appreciated(1) but diversity in female mate choice has received little attention. Males of many species have sexual displays composed of multiple display traits, and females are thought to use these different traits in mate choice(1). Models of multiple display trait evolution suggest that these traits provide females with different kinds of information in different stages of the mate choice process(2), or function as redundant signals to improve the accuracy of mate assessment(3),(4). We suggest that complex male displays might also arise because of variation in female preferences for particular male display traits. The causes of female preference variation have received little attention(5- 7), and the role of preference variation in shaping complex male displays is unclear. Here we show that in satin bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) female mate choice is a multistage process, where females of different ages use different male display traits in successive stages. Age- and stage-specific female preferences may contribute to explaining the widespread occurrence of multifaceted male displays.},

Here we demonstrate a negative relationship between trait heritability and association with lifetime reproductive success in a wild population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) at Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada. Lower heritability for fitness-related traits, however, was not wholly a consequence of declining genetic variance, because those traits showed high levels of residual variance. Genetic correlations estimated between pairs of traits with significant heritability were positive. Principal component analyses suggest that positive relationships between morphometric traits constitute the main axis of genetic variation. Tradeoffs in the form of negative genetic or phenotypic correlations among the traits we have measured do not appear to constrain the potential for evolution in this population.},

   Abstract = {Measurements of the genetic variation and covariation underlying quantitative traits are crucial to our understanding of current evolutionary change and the mechanisms causing this evolution. This fact has spurred a large number of studies estimating heritabilities and genetic correlations in a variety of organisms. Most of these studies have been done in laboratory or greenhouse settings, but it is not well known how accurately these measurements estimate genetic variance and covariance expressed in the field. We conducted a quantitative genetic half-sibling analysis on six floral traits in wild radish. Plants were grown from seed in the field and were exposed to natural environmental variation throughout their lives, including herbivory and intra- and interspecific competition. The estimates of heritabilities and the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) obtained from this analysis were then compared to previous greenhouse estimates of the same floral traits from the same natural population. Heritabilities were much lower in the field for all traits, and this was due to both large increases in environmental variance and decreases in additive genetic variance. Additive genetic covariance expressed was also much lower in the field. These differences resulted in highly significant differences in the G matrix between the greenhouse and field environments using two complementary testing methods. Although the G matrices shared some principal components in common, they were not simply proportional to each other. Therefore, the greenhouse results did not accurately depict how the floral traits would respond to natural selection in the field.},

Here we use DNA expression arrays to examine whether gene-expression profiles in two populations evolved in parallel, which would indicate adaptation, and to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying their adaptation. We compared the expression profile of the ancestor to that of clones sampled from both populations after 20,000 generations. The expression of 59 genes had changed significantly in both populations. Remarkably, all 59 were changed in the same direction relative to the ancestor. Many of these genes were members of the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) regulons. Sequencing of several genes controlling the effectors of these regulons found a nonsynonymous mutation in spoT in one population. Moving this mutation into the ancestral background showed that it increased fitness and produced many of the expression changes manifest after 20,000 generations. The same mutation had no effect on fitness when introduced into the other evolved population, indicating that a mutation of similar effect was present already. Our study demonstrates the utility of expression arrays for addressing evolutionary issues including the quantitative measurement of parallel evolution in independent lineages and the identification of beneficial mutations.},

Male eyespan also showed a great increase in standardized variance under stress, unlike nonsexual traits. The inflated variance of the male ornament was primarily attributable to condition-dependent (but body-size-independent) increase in variance. Thus, evaluation of male eyespan allows females to gain additional information about male condition over and above that given by body size.

The population was released from hunting pressure in 1972. Over the following 10 years population density doubled and, since the early 1980s, has fluctuated around ecological carrying capacity. The cessation of culling led to long-term transient spatial and demographic effects that have persisted for 30 years. Different vital rates responded to the increase in density at different rates, causing long-term changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These changes altered the impact of different age- and sex-specific vital rates on annual changes in population size. These changes are still ongoing, 30 years after cessation of the cull, suggesting that a change in density may generate transient dynamics that persist for several generations.},

   Abstract = {The hypothesis was tested that selection on the basis of family means for increased survival and hen-housed egg production, when sisters with intact beaks were kept together in multiple-bird cages, would cause adaptive changes in behavior. Specifically, it was posited that beak-inflicted injuries causing cannibalistic mortality and feather loss and damage would be reduced. Body weight effects were not predicted, but were examined. Three stocks were compared; the Selected (S), representing the seventh generation of selection, the Randombred Control (C) from which S was derived, and a commercial stock (X), known to be highly productive and beak-trimmed by commercial producers. Pullets were placed in single-bird (1H) as well as in 12-hen (12H) cages using a completely randomized block experimental design. Mortality from beak-inflicted injuries differed among stocks in total hens lost (P < 0.005). Of 576 per stock in 12H cages 287, 128, and 46 replacements were used from 17 to 44 wk in X, C, and S, respectively, to maintain group size. The C and S hens also differed from 44 to 59 wk and 17 to 59 wk. X lens were not included in comparisons of mortality beyond 44 wk, Relative incidence of mortality caused by vent-cloacal injuries differed with X > C = S (P < 0.005 for X vs C and S). For cages with greater than or equal to 1 cannibalistic death, X had twice (P < 0.025) and C 1.6 times (P < 0.10) as many with repeated losses as S. Means and variances of feather scores were different for 1H vs 12H cages, ages, and genetic stocks. Greater variances were observed in 12H cages and among older birds. Within 1H units, genetic stocks did not differ in general, but in 12H cages X and C were always more variable than S. In 12H cages, mean feather scores and body weights were decreased and S hens had better feathering than either C or X. The evidence supported the hypothesis.},

   Abstract = {Genetically distinct anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, develop identical? brilliant red color at maturity during sympatric breeding in freshwater streams. The marine and lacustrine environments they occupy prior to maturity, however, appear to differ in the availability of dietary carotenoid pigments necessary to produce red coloration. We tested the hypothesis that kokanee, which occupy carotenoid-poor lakes, are more efficient at using the dietary pigments than are sockeye, which occupy the more productive North Pacific Ocean. In a 2-year controlled breeding study, flesh and skin color of mature and immature crosses fed a low-carotenoid diet were quantified with both a chromameter and by chemical extraction of carotenoid pigments. Results revealed striking countergradient variation in carotenoid use, with kokanee approximately three times more efficient at sequestering the pigments to the flesh musculature than similar age sockeye. This difference translated into virtually nonoverlapping differences between pure crosses in secondary sexual color at maturity, when the pigments are mobilized and transported to the skin. Kokanee crosses turned pinkish red over most of their body, whereas sockeye turned olive green. The olive green was similar to the breeding color of residuals in the wild, the progeny of anadromous sockeye that remain in fresh water and are believed to have given rise to kokanee on numerous independent occasions. Reciprocal hybrids were similar to each other and intermediate to the pure crosses, indicating additive genetic inheritance. Mate choice trials with sockeye males in the wild showed the ancestral morph strongly preferred red over green models. These results suggest a preference for red mates maintained in nonanadromous breeding populations drove the reevolution of the red phenotype in kokanee via more efficient use of dietary carotenoid pigments. This is a novel, yet hidden, mechanism by which sexual selection promotes the genetic differentiation of these sympatric populations.},

The large sample chi(2) mixture approximations using the usual asymptotic theory for a null hypothesis on the boundary of the parameter space have been shown to be poor in simulation studies. Our asymptotic calculations explain these empirical results. The theory of Self and Liang applies only to linear mixed models for which the data vector can be partitioned into a large number of independent and identically distributed subvectors.

Consequently, traits closely associated with fitness should exhibit high levels of dominance variance. In this study we compile a large number of estimates of dominance variance to determine if traits that are subject to strong selection and/or are closely associated with fitness have higher levels of dominance variance than traits less subject to selection pressure. Estimates were taken from the literature for both wild and domestic species and each group was treated separately. Traits closely associated with fitness (life history) had significantly higher dominance components than did traits more distantly related to fitness (morphology) for wild species. No significant differences were found between life history and morphological traits for domestic species. Traits that were known to have been subject to intense directional selection (morphological traits for domestic species) had significantly higher dominance estimates than did traits that were assumed not to have been subject to strong selection (morphological traits for wild outbred species). The results are discussed with respect to the maintenance of heritable variation and the bias introduced in the calculation of the full-sib heritability estimate by high levels of dominance variance.},

   Pages = {1111-1118},
   Abstract = {Wing dimorphisms exist in a wide range of insects. In wing- dimorphic species one morph is winged, has functional flight muscles (LW), and is flight-capable, whereas the other has reduced wings (SW) and cannot fly. The evolution and maintenance of wing dimorphisms is believed to be due to trade- offs between flight capability and fitness-related traits. Although there are well-established phenotypic trade-offs associated with wing dimorphism in female insects, there only exist two studies that have established a genetic basis to these trade-offs. The present study provides the first evidence for a genetically based trade-off in male insects, specifically in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. Because they have to expend energy to maintain the flight apparatus (especially flight muscles), LW males are predicted to call less and therefore to attract fewer females. To be of evolutionary significance, call duration, wing morph, and wing muscle condition (size and functionality) should all have measurable heritabilities and all. be genetically correlated. Differences between morphs in male G. firmus in the likelihood of attracting a female were tested in the laboratory using a T-maze where females chose between a LW male and a SW male. Call duration for each male was recorded on the sixth day of adult life. A significant difference in call duration was found between SW and LW males (SW = 0.86 +/- 0.01, LW = 0.64 +/- 0.01 h). SW males attracted significantly more females than did LW males (63% vs. to 37%). All the traits involved in the trade-off had significant heritabilities (call = 0.75 +/- 0.33; wing morph = 0.22 +/- 0.07; muscle weight = 0.38 +/- 0.09) and genetic correlations (call and wing morph = -0.46 +/- 0.20 for SW, -0.68 +/- 0.16 for LW; LW call and muscle weight = -0.80 +/- 0.14). These results provide the first documented evidence that trade-offs between a dimorphic trait and a fitness-related character in males has a genetic basis and hence can be of evolutionary significance.},

Yet fundamental differences in color Vision between humans and other animals call this approach into question. Here we use techniques for objectively assessing color patterns that avoid reliance on species-specific (e.g., human) perception. Reflectance spectra are the invariant features that we expect the animal's color cognition to have evolved to extract. We performed multivariate analyses on principal components derived from >2,600 reflectance spectra (300-720 nm) sampled in a stratified random design from different body regions of male and female starlings in breeding plumage. Starlings possess spatially complex plumage patterns and extensive areas of iridescence. Our study revealed previously unnoticed sex differences in plumage coloration and the nature of iridescent and noniridescent sex differences. Sex differences occurred in some body regions bur not others, were more pronounced at some wavelengths (both ultraviolet and human visible), and involved differences in mean reflectance and spectral shape. Discriminant analysis based on principal components were sufficient to sex correctly 100% of our sample. If hidden sexual dichromatism is widespread, then it has important implications for classifications of animals as mono- or dimorphic and for taxonomic and conservation purposes.},

   Abstract = {Males of many insect species increase the fecundity and/or egg size of their mates through the amount or composition of their nuptial gifts or ejaculate. The genetic bases of such male effects on fecundity or egg size are generally unknown, and thus their ability to evolve remains speculative. Likewise, the genetic relationship between male and female investment into reproduction in dioecious species, which is expected to be positive if effects on fecundity are controlled by at least some of the same genes in males and females, is also unknown. Males of the seed beetle Stator limbatus contribute large ejaculates to females during mating, and the amount of donated ejaculate is positively correlated with male body mass. Females mated to large males lay more eggs in their lifetime than females mated to small males. We describe an experiment in which we quantify genetic variation in the number of eggs sired by males (mated to a single female) and found that a significant proportion of the phenotypic variance in the number of eggs sired by males was explained by their genotype. Additionally, the number of eggs sired by a male was highly positively genetically correlated with his body mass. The between-sex genetic correlation, that is, the genetic correlation between the number of eggs sired by males and the number of eggs laid by females, was highly positive when eggs were laid on Acacia greggii seeds. This indicates that males that sire many eggs have sisters that lay many eggs. Thus, some of the genes that control male ejaculate size (or some other fecundity-enhancing factor) when expressed in males appear to control fecundity when expressed in females. We found no significant interaction between male and female genotype on fecundity.},

   Abstract = {The mate sampling behaviour and mate choice of 125 individually marked female pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, was recorded with video cameras. Females visited on average 3.1 males within a period of less than 1 day. Females had independent preferences for unmated males, brightly coloured males and males with nestboxes that had small entrance holes; 77-86% of the females chose a male that was the best one among the males sampled in relation to at least one of these factors. When having a choice only on mating status 91% of the females made a correct choice; corresponding values fbr plumage colour and nest site quality were 64% and 73%, respectively. Females made 'mistakes' more often when differences between males were small, at least regarding plumage colour. When given simultaneous choices on two cues, females gave priority to the cue with the largest differences between males. Females returned to some males before rejecting them and these males tended to have brighter plumage or better nestboxes than males that were visited only once. The final choice of mate was not related to the order in the sequence of males visited, suggesting that many females used a pool-comparison strategy. However, about one third of the females visited only one male, and one third sampled males in a way conforming to threshold or sequential comparison strategies as well as a pool-comparison strategy. The temporal pattern of female visits suggested that they either sampled males at once and then settled, or that they visited one male repeatedly and made occasional visits to other males, often after a long period of residency. Twenty- eight females (22%) made visits to other males after they had settled (he. started nest building) with one male, and this resulted in mate switching in seven cases (6% of all females). These results show that females compare and choose mates on the basis of at least three different cues, and that most females are able to pick out the best or one of the best males among those sampled. However, females sample few males, probably because of competition between females for a mate, so that they must sometimes accept dull or mated males, or males with poor- quality nest sites. Limited choice reduces the strength of sexual selection even when female preferences are strong. This may help explain why plumage colour variation and polygyny exist in the pied flycatcher.},

The plumage ornamentation of male red-billed queleas, Quelea quelea, is an ideal candidate for an indicator because it is continuously variable, conspicuous, sexually dimorphic, is displayed only during breeding and is partially based, on carotenoid pigmentation. However, I show here that quelea plumage is not an indicator be,cause first, plumage colour is not correlated with physical condition or age; second, plumage colour is a genitically determined phenotype that is unresponsive to environmental variation; third, different plumage characters have bimodal distributions; fourth, plumage characters vary indepen- dently of one another; and finally plumage colour is not correlated with reproductive success. To my knowledge, this is the first demonstration of non-condition dependence in colourful and sexually dimorphic breeding ornamentation. Instead, plumage variation may function as a sexually selected signal of individual identity among territorial males that nest in huge, densely packed and highly synchronized colonies.},

In this paper we derive and implement a bivariate quantitative genetic model for a threshold character and a survival trait that are genetically and environmentally correlated. For the survival trait, we considered the Weibull log-normal animal frailty model. A Bayesian approach using Gibbs sampling was adopted in which model parameters were augmented with unobserved liabilities associated with the threshold trait. The fully conditional posterior distributions associated with parameters of the threshold trait reduced to well known distributions. For the survival trait the two baseline Weibull parameters were updated jointly by a Metropolis-Hastings step. The remaining model parameters with non-normalized fully conditional distributions were updated univariately using adaptive rejection sampling. The Gibbs sampler was tested in a simulation study and illustrated in a joint analysis of calving difficulty and longevity of dairy cattle. The simulation study showed that the estimated marginal posterior distributions covered well and placed high density to the true values used in the simulation of data. The data analysis of calving difficulty and longevity showed that genetic variation exists for both traits. The additive genetic correlation was moderately favorable with marginal posterior mean equal to 0.37 and 95% central posterior credibility interval ranging between 0.11 and 0.61. Therefore, this study suggests that selection for improving one of the two traits will be beneficial for the other trait as well.},

The complicating factors in this analysis are that the CD4-lymphocyte count is observed only at certain fixed times and with a high degree of measurement error, and that the length of the vector of observations is determined, in part, by the length of survival. If probability of death depends on the true, unobserved CD4-lymphocyte count, then the survival process must be modelled. Wu and Carroll (1988, Biometrics 44, 175-188) proposed a random effects model for two-sample longitudinal data in the presence of informative censoring, in which the individual effects included only slopes and intercepts. We propose methods for fitting a broad class of models of this type, in which both the repeated CD4-lymphocyte counts and the survival time are modelled using random effects. These methods permit us to estimate parameters describing the progression of CD4-lymphocyte count as well as the effect of differences in the CD4 trajectory on survival.

   Abstract = {We investigate a genetic model in which two traits result from the acquisition and allocation of a single resource. Phenotypic values for the two traits are written as a product of the total amount of the resource acquired and the proportion allotted to each of them. Although multiplicative gene action determines the traits, the epistasis at the gene level is mainly expressed in the additive genetic variance and covariance at the level of the measured traits. Phenotypic and additive genetic covariances between the two traits can be positive or negative; a negative additive genetic covariance can be accompanied by a positive phenotypic covariance. An acquisition-allocation model is the only model of multiplicative gene action that allows simultaneous selection on two traits to be written in matrix form. We use the model of resource acquisition and allocation to find the life-history consequences of acquisition of a resource and allocation to two traits. Two alternative allocation strategies-priority allocation to viability or to fecundity-lead to different evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) in life-history components. Primary allocation to fecundity has allocation fractions of zero or one as its stable state. Primary allocation to viability leads to an ESS allocation fraction that depends on resource availability, population growth rate. and the age structure of the population. In a poor environment and for inherently long-lived animals, the ESS allocation fraction tends in the direction of higher viability.},

   Abstract = {1. The sign and magnitude of covariances between traits involved in a trade-off depend upon two factors: the trade-off pattern between the amounts of resource devoted to the traits and the transformation from amount of resource to trait. 2. Let a single resource be divided over many traits, leading to a complicated pattern of trade-offs between the traits. A trade- off pattern can be modelled as a 'tree', with resource acquisition as the trunk, each allocation decision as a dichotomous 'branching point' and the amount of resource devoted to a trait at the outer end of the branches. In a 'major' allocation, the fractions of resource going to each of the two alternative 'branches' are appreciable. 3. In the presence of variation in acquisition and in the allocations, the covariances between the amounts of resource allocated to the traits are shown to depend upon their position relative to the allocation tree and upon allocation magnitudes. The First Major Allocation after acquisition of the resource is the one most likely to lead to a negative covariance between traits. Allocations higher in the allocation tree than the First Major Allocation tend to lead to positive covariances between traits. Traits in a trade-off system will therefore show clusters, traits showing positive correlations within the cluster and negative correlations between different clusters. 4. Partial correlations might be used to find where a trait originates in the allocation tree. 5. Transformation from amounts of resource allocated to the trait itself obscures the covariance and partial correlation pattern.},

We studied whether male secondary sexual ornaments are selected through within- and/or extra-pair reproductive success in the blue tit (Parus caeruleus). Male blue tits display a bright blue crown plumage, which reflects substantially in the ultraviolet (UV) and previously has been indicated to be an important sexual signal. We show that males with a more UV-shifted crown hue were less cuckolded, which probably resulted from female preference for more ornamented mates. By contrast, however, older males and males with a less UV-shifted hue sired more extra-pair young. This probably did not reflect direct female preference, since cuckolders were not less UV-ornamented than the males they cuckolded. Alternatively, a trade-off between UV ornamentation and other traits that enhance extra-pair success could explain this pattern. Our results might reflect two alternative male mating tactics, where more UV-ornamented males maximize within-pair success and less UV-ornamented males maximize extra-pair success. Since crown colour was selected in opposite directions by within-pair and extra-pair paternity, directional selection through extra-pair matings seemed weak, at least in this population and breeding season. Reduced intensity of sexual selection due to alternative mating tactics constitutes a potential mechanism maintaining additive genetic variance of male ornaments.},

   Abstract = {Rearing full siblings under different environmental conditions allows partitioning of the total phenotypic variance of a trait into its genetic and environmental components. This, in natural bird populations, is usually achieved by cross-fostering experimental designs. We estimated genetic and environmental components of nestling-fitness traits using an alternative experimental approach in a magpie (Pica pica) population. Two broods of full siblings were reared under contrasting environmental conditions of first and replacement clutches. With this approach, potential maternal effects related to differences in clutch size and egg size could also be partially evaluated. In addition, the nutritional condition of half of the nestlings within each nest was manipulated by providing a calorie-rich paste enriched with micronutrients. Our results are only indicative because of very low sample sizes. In food- supplemented nestlings, the heritability estimates of tarsus length, body mass and T-cell-mediated immune response tended to be higher compared with control nestlings. No causal conclusions could be drawn for changes in heritability estimates of body mass and T-cell-mediated immune response; for tarsus length, the results suggest a lower potential to adapt to poor nutritional conditions. Furthermore, we found some indication that maternal effects related to clutch/egg size inflated causal estimates of phenotypic variance in tarsus length.},

Alternative approaches in mammals, relying on phylogenetic comparisons of pseudogene loci(2) and fourfold degenerate codon positions(3), suffer from uncertainties in the actual number of generations separating the compared species and the inability to exclude biases associated with natural selection. Here we provide a direct and unbiased estimate of the nuclear mutation rate and its molecular spectrum with a set of C. elegans mutation-accumulation lines that reveal a mutation rate about tenfold higher than previous indirect estimates and an excess of insertions over deletions. Because deletions dominate patterns of C. elegans pseudogene variation(4,5), our observations indicate that natural selection might be significant in promoting small genome size, and challenge the prevalent assumption that pseudogene divergence accurately reflects the spontaneous mutation spectrum.},

   Abstract = {Dispersal is a major determinant of the dynamics and genetic structure of populations, and its consequences depend not only on average dispersal rates and distances, but also on the characteristics of dispersing and philopatric individuals. We investigated whether natal dispersal correlated with a predisposed behavioural trait: exploratory behaviour in novel environments. Wild great tits were caught in their natural habitat, tested the following morning in the laboratory using an open field test and released at the capture site. Natal dispersal correlated positively with parental and individual exploratory behaviour, using three independent datasets. First, fast-exploring parents had offspring that dispersed furthest. Second, immigrants were faster explorers than locally born birds. Third, post-fledging movements, comprising a major proportion of the variation in natal dispersal distances, were greater for fast females than for slow females. These findings suggest that parental behaviour influenced offspring natal dispersal either via parental behaviour per se (e.g. via post- fledging care) or by affecting the phenotype of their offspring (e.g. via their genes). Because this personality trait has a genetic basis, our results imply that genotypes differ in their dispersal distances. Therefore, the described patterns have profound consequences for the genetic composition of populations.},

The proximate basis of variation in personality traits has received considerable attention, and one general finding is that personality traits have a substantial genetic basis. This poses the question of how variation in personality is maintained in natural populations. We show that selection on a personality trait with high heritability fluctuates across years within a natural bird population. Annual adult survival was related to this personality trait (behaviour in novel environments) but the effects were always opposite for males and females, and reversed between years. The number of offspring surviving to breeding was also related to their parents' personalities, and again selection changed between years. The observed annual changes in selection pressures coincided with changes in environmental conditions (masting of beeches) that affect the competitive regimes of the birds. We expect that the observed fluctuations in environmental factors lead to fluctuations in competition for space and food, and these, in association with variations in population density, lead to a variation in selection pressure, which maintains genetic variation in personalities.},

   Volume = {52},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {1247-1262},
   Abstract = {We propose a new method to estimate and correct for phylogenetic inertia in comparative data analysis. The method, called phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) starts by performing a principal coordinate analysis on a pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix between species. Traits under analysis are regressed on eigenvectors retained by a broken-stick model in such a way that estimated values express phylogenetic trends in data and residuals express independent evolution of each species. This partitioning is similar to that realized by the spatial autoregressive method, but the method proposed here overcomes the problem of low statistical performance that occurs with autoregressive method when phylogenetic correlation is low or when sample size is too small to detect it. Also, PVR is easier to perform with large samples because it is based on well-known techniques of multivariate and regression analyses. We evaluated the performance of PVR and compared it with the autoregressive method using real datasets and simulations. A detailed worked example using body size evolution of Carnivora mammals indicated that phylogenetic inertia in this trait is elevated and similarly estimated by both methods. In this example, Type I error at alpha = 0.05 of PVR was equal to 0.048, but an increase in the number of eigenvectors used in the regression increases the error. Also, similarity between PVR and the autoregressive method, defined by correlation between their residuals, decreased by overestimating the number of eigenvalues necessary to express the phylogenetic distance matrix. To evaluate the influence of cladogram topology on the distribution of eigenvalues extracted from the double-centered phylogenetic distance matrix, we analyzed 100 randomly generated cladograms (up Ito 100 species). Multiple linear regression of log transformed variables indicated that the number of eigenvalues extracted by the broken-stick model can be fully explained by cladogram topology. Therefore, the broken-stick model is an adequate criterion for determining the correct number of eigenvectors to be used by PVR. We also simulated distinct levels of phylogenetic inertia by producing a trend across 10, 25, and 50 species arranged in "comblike" cladograms and then adding random vectors with increased residual variances around this trend. In doing so, we provide an evaluation of the performance of both methods with data generated under different evolutionary models than tested previously. The results showed that both PVR and autoregressive method are efficient in detecting inertia in data when sample size is relatively high (more than 25 species) and when phylogenetic inertia is high. However, PVR is more efficient at smaller sample sizes and when level of phylogenetic inertia is low. These conclusions were also supported by the analysis of 10 real datasets regarding body size evolution in different animal clades. We concluded that PVR can be a useful alternative to an autoregressive method in comparative data analysis.},

The pedigree sampling method is 1 computing strategy for calculating these breeding values. This paper describes and discusses methods for dealing with a number of practical issues that arise when implementing such a system for industry use. In particular, diagnostic systems for detecting inadequacies or possible errors in the genotyping systems and the recording of animal management are developed. Also, characteristics of the best assigned pedigrees are calculated according to mating group and used to check for sires missing from these groups. The correlation between breeding values estimated from a single sampled pedigree (using parentage probabilities) and those estimated as the mean from many sampled pedigrees gives a diagnostic to indicate which estimated breeding values are more influenced by uncertainties in relationships. For the analysis of survival traits, a method to enumerate and assign likely parentage to dead offspring which have not been DNA sampled and genotyped is described. When embryo transfer technology is used, the genetic dam needs to be included as a possible dam when considering parentage. If some fixed effects which depend on the parent are missing, these can be sampled similarly to parentage, and this may improve the evaluation if certain assumptions are met. A method to provide a likely list of parents, the 'fitted pedigree', which is based on the most likely parents, but modified to reduce the occurrence of unlikely family sets (e.g. very large litters) is also presented. The use of these methods will enhance the practical application of DNA parenting when used in conjunction with genetic evaluation.},

Blue tit songs with trill are mon common in open habitats. We hypothesised that blue tit songs with trill are sung less frequently in dense vegetation because they reduce the efficiency of communication in these types of vegetation. We degraded blue tit songs with and without trill in dense vegetation. To test if degraded songs with trill are less efficient in communication than degraded songs without trill, we presented territorial blue tits to these degraded and undegraded songs and quantified blue tits' territorial responses. Tests were carried out in two blue tit study populations situated in deciduous woodlands where individuals produce both songs with trill and without trill. Undegraded songs provoked stronger responses than degraded songs. Degraded songs with and without trill induced similar responses. These results suggest that, in dense vegetation, songs with trill are as efficient in communication in adults than songs without trill, perhaps because songs without trill degrade in a different way than do songs with trill.},

We studied this relationship in three populations presenting differences in density, quantity of food available and relative and absolute densities of Great Tits Parus major. Great Tit density may be an important factor because this species is supposed to be in competition for acoustic space with the Blue Tit.

In order to determine the environmental factors influencing geographic variation in the proportion of blue tit songs with a trill, we conducted a comparative study. At macrogeographic and regional scales we examined the effect of three factors that could influence geographic variation in blue tit song: dominant vegetation type, intraspecific competition and interspecific competition with great tits (Par ns major). Interspecific competition may result in song convergence or song divergence thereafter called character shift). The results we obtained are consistent with predictions of the character shift hypothesis: the proportion of songs presenting a different syntax to great tit songs (songs with a trill) increases significantly with relative great tit density.

   Abstract = {Selection should favor flexibility in reproductive tactics when the combination of sexual traits and reproductive behaviors that achieve the highest fitness differs between males within a population. Understanding the functional significance of variation in male reproductive tactics can provide insight into their evolution. Male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) in a Montana population display continuous variation in parental tactics: males with more elaborated (redder) plumage color provide little or no parental care compared to less elaborated (dull) males. Here, we first determined whether elevation of prolactin (a pituitary hormone) was related to variation in male parental tactics and, second, we used the relationship between prolactin levels and parental behavior to investigate why redder males avoid a high investment in parental care. We found that prolactin elevation was closely associated with paternal care. In addition, males with redder plumage color had low prolactin levels, whereas dull males, which provision twice as frequently, had high levels of prolactin. We also found that male condition was unrelated to plumage color but negatively related to prolactin levels. These results suggest that the low provisioning of redder males was not due to physiological constraints, but instead reflected a tactic to avoid the costs associated with parental care. The condition benefits accrued by redder males may explain their higher post-breeding survival compared to dull males. Moreover, dull males were previously shown to have higher pairing success than redder males, suggesting that the relationship between male plumage color and parental care may reflect individually optimized parental tactics.},

For PP, this model could be further simplified to a non-stratified Weibull model. The extension of these models to sire-dam frailty (mixed) models permitted the estimation of the sire genetic variances at 0.261 +/- 0.026 and 0.088 +/- 0.010 for RP and PP, respectively. Heritabilities on the log scale were equal to 0.48 and 0.19. Non-additive genetic effects could not be detected. Selection was simulated by evaluating all sires and dams, after excluding all records from the last generation. Thee, actual parents of this last generation were distributed into four groups according to their own pedigree index. Raw survivor curves of the progeny of extreme parental groups substantially differed (e.g., by 1.7% at 300 days for PP), suggesting that selection based on solutions from the frailty models could be efficient, despite the very large proportion of censored records.},

   Abstract = {1. The Hamilton and Zuk hypothesis proposes that within species, individuals with more elaborate secondary sexual traits signal their higher resistance to parasites. 2. Intraspecific tests of the correlation between secondary sexual traits and parasite load have given equivocal results, probably because of difficulties in deciding which parasite species are important for the process of sexual selection. 3. In this study we use a different approach by relating secondary sexual traits to the level of immune response in the hosts rather than the parasite load. It is well known that the number and proportions of different types of leucocytes reflect the health status of individuals, as these cells quickly respond to stress and infectious diseases. 4. The number and proportions of different types of leucocytes were counted in blood smears from male Great Tits, Parus major and the intensities of the males' yellow plumage coloration were scored, in 1991 and 1992 on Gotland, SE Sweden. 5. We found a positive correlation between number and proportion of heterophils and colour intensity. 6. More than one interpretation is possible though we favour the view that brighter males signal low parasitation intensity as a result of their superior immunity.},

   Abstract = {In many species of monogamous birds females copulate with males other than their social mates, resulting in extrapair fertilizations. Little is known about how females choose extrapair mates and whether the traits used to choose them are reliable indicators of male quality. Here we identify a novel male trait associated with extra-group mating success in the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), a cooperatively breeding bird with one of the highest known frequencies of extra-group mating. Female fairy-wrens chose extra-group mates that molted earlier into breeding plumage. Males molted up to five months before the breeding season began, and only males that molted at least one month prior to its onset gained any extra-group fertilizations. This conclusion held after controlling statistically for the effect of age and social status on molt date. Once males acquired breeding plumage, they began courtship display to females on other territories. Thus, some males were displaying to females for several months before the breeding season began. This extraordinarily long period of advertisement by males may be facilitated by the long-term ownership of territories. We suggest that early acquisition of breeding plumage or the subsequent display behavior can be reliable cues for mate choice because they are costly to acquire or maintain.},

   Abstract = {Livestock populations are usually kept in groups. As a consequence, social interactions among individuals affect productivity, health, and welfare. Current selection methods (individual selection), however, ignore those interactions and yield suboptimal or in some cases even negative responses. In principle, selection between groups instead of individuals offers a solution, but has rarely been adopted in practice for two reasons. First, the relationship between group selection theory and common animal breeding concepts, such as the accuracy of selection, is nuclear. Second, application of group selection requires keeping selection candidates ill groups, which is often undesirable in practice. This work has two objectives. First, we derive expressions for the accuracy of individual and group selection, which provides a measurement of quality for those methods. Second, we investigate the opportunity to improve traits affected by interactions by rising information oil relatives kept. in family groups, while keeping selection candidates individually. The accuracy of selection based oil relatives is shown to be all analogy of the classical expression for traits not, affected by interactions. Our results show that selection based on relatives offers good opportunities for effective genetic improvement of traits affected by interactions.},

The integral projection model ( IPM) avoids discrete classes and potential artifacts from arbitrary class divisions, facilitates parsimonious modeling based on smooth relationships between individual state and demographic performance, and can be implemented with standard matrix software. Here, we extend the IPM to species with complex demographic attributes, including dormant and active life stages, cross- classification by several attributes ( e. g., size, age, and condition), and changes between discrete and continuous structure over the life cycle. We present a general model encompassing these cases, numerical methods, and theoretical results, including stable population growth and sensitivity/ elasticity analysis for density- independent models, local stability analysis in density- dependent models, and optimal/ evolutionarily stable strategy life- history analysis. Our presentation centers on an IPM for the thistle Onopordum illyricum based on a 6- year field study. Flowering and death probabilities are size and age dependent, and individuals also vary in a latent attribute affecting survival, but a predictively accurate IPM is completely parameterized by fitting a few regression equations.

Paternal and maternal genotypes reconstructed for each of the three strings were identical, strongly indicating that a single female produced the strings that were fertilized by the same four males.

Horn development is typically confined to males (sexual dimorphism) and often only to the largest males (male dimorphism). Both types of dimorphism result from endocrine threshold mechanisms that coordinate cell proliferation near the end of the larval period. Here, we map the presence/absence of each type of dimorphism onto a recent phylogeny for the genus Onthophagits (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) to explore how horn development has changed over time. Our results provide empirical support for several recent predictions regarding the evolutionary lability of developmental thresholds, including uncoupled evolution of alternative phenotypes and repeated fixation of phenotypes. We also report striking evidence of a possible developmental constraint. We show that male dimorphism and sexual dimorphism map together on the phylogeny; whenever small males have horns, females also have horns (and vice versa). We raise the possibility that correlated evolution of these two phenomena results from a shared element in their endocrine regulatory mechanisms rather than a history of common selection pressures. These results illustrate the type of insight that can be gained only from the integration of developmental and evolutionary perspectives.},

Natural selection favors signals, receptors, and signaling behavior that maximize the received signals relative to background noise and minimize signal degradation. Properties of sensory systems bias the direction of evolution of the signals that they receive. For example, females may prefer males whose signals they can perceive more easily, and this will lead to the spread of more easily perceived male traits. Environmental conditions during signal transmission and detection also affect signal perception. Specific environmental conditions will bias the evolutionary direction of behavior, which affects the time and place of signaling as well as microhabitat preferences. Increased specialization of microhabitats and signaling behavior may lead to biased evolution of the sensory systems to work more efficiently. Thus, sensory systems, signals, signaling behavior, and habitat choice are evolutionarily coupled. These suites of traits should coevolve in predictable directions, determined by environmental biophysics, neurobiology, and the genetics of the suites of traits-hence the term "sensory drive." Because conditions vary in space and time, diversity will be generated.},

   Abstract = {Forests exhibit much variation in light environments, and this can affect communication among animals, communication between animals and plants, photosynthesis, and plant morphogenesis. Light environments are caused by, and can be predicted from, the geometry of the light paths, the weather conditions, and the time of day. The structure of forests leads to four major light habitats when the sun is not blocked by clouds: forest shade, woodland shade, small gaps, and large gaps. These are characterized by yellow-green, blue-gray, reddish, and ''white'' ambient light spectra, respectively. When the sun is blocked by clouds, the spectra of these four habitats converge on that of large gaps and open areas, so the single light environment during cloudy weather will be called open/cloudy. An additional light environment (early/late) is associated with low sun angles (near dawn or dusk); it is purplish. Each light environment is well defined and was found in forests of Trinidad, Panama, Costa Pica, Australia, California, and Florida. Scattered literature references suggest similar patterns elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Java. Perceived colors of animals, flowers, and fruits depend upon the interaction between ambient light color and the reflectance color of the animal or plant parts. As a result, an animal or plant may have a different appearance in each environment, i.e., a color pattern may be relatively cryptic in some light environments while relatively conspicuous in others. This has strong implications for the joint evolution of visual signals and vision, as well as microhabitat choice. Plant growth and form may also be affected by variation in the color of forest light.},

Multiple-regression analysis suggests that mate- preference criteria vary among localities in intensity, sign, and the number of traits used.

We investigated three lekking birds at Nourages field station, French Guiana: Rupicola rupicola, Corapipo gutturalis, and Lepidothrix serena. Conspicuousness is a function of ambient light spectra during displays and the reflectance spectra of color pattern elements of the birds and their visual backgrounds. Each species places its lek and performs its lek displays in only one or two of the available light environments, and some may specialize in the more extreme spectra even within each light environment. The color patterns and behavior of each species maximize its visual contrast during its display and reduce it off the lek or on the lek but not displaying. Each species does this with a different combination of colors and light environments. If this phenomenon is general, then it has important implications for the evolution of color patterns and display behavior.},

Because color patterns are used in communication, selection for signal efficacy, relative to the intended receiver's visual system, may explain and predict the direction of evolution. We investigated this in bowerbirds, whose color patterns consist of plumage, bower structure, and ornaments and whose visual displays are presented under predictable visual conditions. We used data on avian vision, environmental conditions, color pattern properties, and an estimate of the bowerbird phylogeny to test hypotheses about evolutionary effects of visual processing. Different components of the color pattern evolve differently. Plumage sexual dimorphism increased and then decreased, while overall (plumage plus bower) visual contrast increased. The use of bowers allows relative crypsis of the bird but increased efficacy of the signal as a whole. Ornaments do not elaborate existing plumage features but instead are innovations (new color schemes) that increase signal efficacy. Isolation between species could be facilitated by plumage but not ornaments, because we observed character displacement only in plumage. Bowerbird color pattern evolution is at least partially predictable from the function of the visual system and from knowledge of different functions of different components of the color patterns. This provides clues to how more constrained visual signaling systems may evolve.},

Here, we modify this method to consider all possible pairs of individuals in the sample, to test for additional relationships, to allow explicitly for genotyping error, and to include X-linked data. Using autosomal genome scan data, our method has excellent power to differentiate monozygotic twins, full sibs, parent-offspring pairs, second-degree (2 degrees) relatives, first cousins, and unrelated pairs but is unable to distinguish accurately among the 2 degrees relationships of half sibs, avuncular pairs, and grandparent-grandchild pairs. Inclusion of X-linked data improves our ability to distinguish certain types of 2 degrees relationships. Our method also models genotyping error successfully, to judge by the recovery of MZ twins and parent-offspring pairs that are otherwise misclassified when error exists.

   Abstract = {Deleterious mutation accumulation has been implicated in many biological phenomena and as a potentially significant threat to human health and the persistence of small populations. The vast majority of mutations with effects on fitness are known to be deleterious in a given environment, and their accumulation results in mean population fitness decline. However, whether populations are capable of recovering from negative effects of prolonged genetic bottlenecks via beneficial or compensatory mutation accumulation has not previously been tested. To address this question, long-term mutation-accumulation lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, previously propagated as single individuals each generation, were maintained in large population sizes under competitive conditions. Fitness assays of these lines and comparison to parallel mutation-accumulation lines and the ancestral control show that, while the process of fitness restoration was incomplete for some lines, full recovery of mean fitness was achieved in fewer than 80 generations. Several lines of evidence indicate that this fitness restoration was at least partially driven by compensatory mutation accumulation rather than a result of a generic form of laboratory adaptation. This surprising result has broad implications for the influence of the mutational process on many issues in evolutionary and conservation biology.},

   Abstract = {The consequences Of Mutation for population-genetic and evolutionary processes depend on the rate and, especially, the frequency distribution of mutational effects on fitness. We sought to approximate the form of the distribution of mutational effects by conducting divergence experiments in which lines of a DNA repair-deficient strain of Caenorhabditis elegans, msh-2, were maintained at a range of population sizes. Assays of these lines conducted in parallel with the ancestral control suggest that the mutational variance is dominated by contributions from highly detrimental imitations. This was evidenced by the ability of all but the smallest population- size treatments to maintain relatively high levels of mean fitness even under the 100-fold increase in mutational pressure caused by knocking out the msh-2 gene. However, we show that the mean fitness decline experienced by larger populations is actually greater than expected on the basis of our estimates of mutational parameters, which could be consistent with the existence of a common class of initiations with small individual effects. Further, comparison of the total mutation rate estimated from direct sequencing of DNA to that detected from phenotypic analyses implies the existence of a large class of evolutionarily relevant mutations with no measurable effect on laboratory fitness.},

Bivariate relationships of mutational effects indicate the existence of extensive pleiotropy. We find that mutations may tend to produce manifold effects on suites of functionally related traits; however, our data do not support the idea of completely parcelated pleiotropy, in which functional units are separately affected by mutations. Positive net phenotypic and mutational correlations are common for life-history traits, with environmental correlations being comparatively smaller and of the same sign for most pairs of traits. Observed mutational correlations are shown to be higher than those produced by the chance accumulation of nonpleiotropic mutations in the same lines.},

Males are bright iridescent green, with scarlet pectoral tufts which are displayed prominently during aggressive interactions with other males. We investigated the role of pectoral tufts in territory defence using natural variation and experimental manipulation. Males with naturally large pectoral tufts defended more L. telekii inflorescences than males with smaller tufts, and achieved a higher reproductive success. Males were subjected to one of three experimental treatments - having their pectoral tufts enlarged, reduced or manipulated but kept at the same size. Males with reduced tufts spend more time in aggressive interactions than the control males, the interactions lasted longer and they lost a number of inflorescences to neighbours. Males with enlarged pectoral tufts increased the number of inflorescences defended.

In this paper, we address both of these issues in a single analysis by modelling a continuous covariate over time and simultaneously relating the covariate to disease risk. We use the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique of Gibbs sampling to estimate the joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameters of the model. Simulation studies showed that jointly modelling survival and covariate data reduced bias in parameter estimates due to covariate measurement error and informative censoring. We illustrate the methodology by application to a data set that consists of repeated measurements of the immunologic marker CD4 and times of diagnosis of AIDS for a cohort of anti-HIV-1 positive recipients of anti-HIV-1 positive blood transfusions. We assume a linear random effects model with subject-specific intercepts and slopes and normal errors for the true log and square root CD4 counts, and a proportional hazards model for AIDS-free survival time expressed as a function of current true CD4 value. On the square root scale, the joint approach yielded a mean slope for CD4 that was 7 per cent steeper and a log relative risk of AIDS that was 35 per cent larger than those obtained by analysis of the component sub-models separately.},

   Abstract = {Comparative methods analyses have usually assumed that the species phenotypes are the true means for those species. In most analyses, the actual values used are means of samples of modest size. The covariances of contrasts then involve both the covariance of evolutionary changes and a fraction of the within-species phenotypic covariance, the fraction depending on the sample size for that species. Ives et al. have shown how to analyze data in this case when the within-species phenotypic covariances are known. The present model allows them to be unknown and to be estimated from the data. A multivariate normal statistical model is used for multiple characters in samples of finite size from species related by a known phylogeny, under the usual Brownian motion model of change and with equal within-species phenotypic covariances. Contrasts in each character can be obtained both between individuals within a species and between species. Each contrast can be taken for all of the characters. These sets of contrasts, each the same contrast taken for different characters, are independent. The within-set covariances are unequal and depend on the unknown true covariance matrices. An expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for making a reduced maximum likelihood estimate of the covariances of evolutionary change and the within-species phenotypic covariances. It is available in the Contrast program of the PHYLIP package. Computer simulations show that the covariances are biased when the finiteness of sample size is not taken into account and that using the present model corrects the bias. Sampling variation reduces the power of inference of covariation in evolution of different characters. An extension of this method to incorporate estimates of additive genetic covariances from a simple genetic experiment is also discussed.},

Parasites have been proposed as playing an important role in shaping these preferences because, by pairing with brightly coloured individuals, females can obtain parasite-free and/or more healthy mates. 3, In this paper one of the predictions of this hypothesis is tested, namely a higher health level in brightly coloured individuals, by analysing the relationships among blood parasites, leucocyte levels and plumage brightness in the Girl Bunting, Emberiza cirlus. 4, Two species of blood parasites were detected. Whereas a lower body condition was detected in individuals infected by Leucocytozoon cambournaci, no such differences were associated with Plasmodium relictum infections. Infected individuals showed higher total leucocyte counts than non-infected individuals. 5. Colour intensity of carotenoid derived colorations was negatively correlated to the relative proportion of lymphocytes and positively correlated to the relative presence of heterophils. Furthermore, the size of yellow feathered areas was positively correlated with the absolute number of leucocytes and the relative presence of heterophils. Only some of these relationships were found for non-carotenoid derived traits. 6, These results suggest that male plumage yellow coloration in the Girl Bunting is a reliable indicator of health status and supports the hypothesis that females obtain more parasite-free mates if they pair with brightly coloured individuals.},

We model five intrinsic (body size, habitat specialization, diet, reproductive rate and range size) and four extrinsic (climate and range overlap with introduced foxes, sheep and rabbits) factors. We use quantitative measures of geographical range contraction as indices of decline. We also develop a new modelling approach of phylogenetically independent contrasts combined with imputation of missing values to deal simultaneously with phylogenetic structuring and missing data. One extrinsic variable-geographical range overlap with sheep-was the only consistent predictor of declines. Habitat specialization was independently but less consistently associated with declines. This suggests that extrinsic factors largely determine interspecific variation in extinction risk among Australian marsupials, and that the intrinsic factors that are consistently associated with extinction risk in other vertebrates are less important in this group. We conclude that recent anthropogenic changes have been profound enough to affect species on a continent-wide scale, regardless of their intrinsic biology.},

In the experiment, nests were either infested with hen fleas, Ceratophyllus gallinae, or kept free of parasites. The color of the two traits and the size of the melanin-based breast stripe were assessed both in the year of experimental parasite infestation and during the following breeding season, after the annual molt. The size of the breast stripe of infested males and females significantly decreased, but increased significantly in uninfested males and females. The blackness of the breast stripe and the carotenoid-based plumage coloration was unaffected. Our experiment demonstrates that the size of the melanin-based breast stripe of adults depends on parasite infestation, suggesting that the trait can serve as an honest signal of previous parasite exposure.},

We analysed the relative importance of the proposed carotenoid sources in a field experiment on great tit nestlings (Parus major). In a within-brood design we supplemented nestlings with carotenoids shortly after hatching, later on in the nestling life, or with a placebo. We show that the carotenoid-based colour expression of nestlings is modified maximally during the first 6 days after hatching. It reveals that the observed variation in carotenoid-based coloration is based only on mechanisms acting during a short period of time in early nestling life. The experiment further suggests that paternally derived carotenoids are the most important determinants of nestling plumage colour.},

A new mechanism for the maintenance of 'good genes' is proposed: in migratory birds, variation in the genes influencing migration is maintained in the population by fluctuating directional selection caused by the effects of climatic trends on the suitability of overwintering environments. The suitability of a surviving migrant's overwintering area affects its spring condition and is reflected in its breeding plumage; environmentally influenced phenotypic condition is thereby associated with migratory genes and condition-dependent traits available for sexual selection. This hypothesis predicts that migratory birds should be more colourful than residents, whereas, because in migrants the correlation and hence coevolution between parasitism and coloration is lower than in residents, the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis of parasite resistance 'good genes' predicts the opposite. Comparison of 37 phylogenetically independent intrageneric pairs of species showed migrants to have significantly more contrasting and colourful plumage and bare parts than residents: the 'good migrations' mechanism rather than the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis is thus supported for migrant bird coloration.},

For structural coloration produced by coloured portions of barbules which are susceptible to loss by abrasion, the intensity of colour is suggested to signal feather quality and abrasion-resistance, the structural colour constituting an amplifying handicap. In both cases, large areas of structural coloured plumage may be more revealing of quality than small areas. Predictions as to the extent, position and combinations of these structural colours relative to carotenoid and melanin coloration were derived from these mechanisms and supported by comparative tests. Structural coloration may thus be a component in multiple messages of individual quality in plumage coloration.},

   Abstract = {After an estimated five million years of independent evolution, the barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum mavortium) was introduced by bait dealers into the native range of the California tiger salamander (A. californiense). Hybridization and backcrossing have been occurring in central California for 50-60 years, or an estimated 15-30 generations. We studied genetic and ecological factors influencing admixture of these two divergent gene pools by analyzing frequencies of hybrid genotypes in three kinds of breeding habitats: natural vernal pools, ephemeral man-made cattle ponds, and perennial man-made ponds. Perennial ponds tended to have higher frequencies of nonnative alleles than either type of seasonal pond, even in cases where perennial and seasonal ponds are within a few hundred meters. Thus, the hybrid zone has a mosaic structure that depends on pond hydrology or ecology. The presence of some broadly acting constraints on admixture is suggested by linkage disequilibria between physically unlinked molecular markers within ponds. In addition, we found several marker-specific deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. One marker showed a consistent deficit of heterozygotes across pond types. Another showed heterozygote deficits only in vernal pools. A third was more likely to have heterozygote excess in ephemeral cattle ponds. These patterns indicate that admixture is influenced by complex genotype-by-environment interactions.},

   Abstract = {Accounting for the abundance of genetic variation in the face of natural selection remains a central problem of evolutionary biology(1,2). Genetic polymorphisms are constantly arising through mutation, and although most are promptly eliminated(3), polymorphisms in functionally important traits are common. One mechanism that can maintain polymorphisms is negative frequency-dependent selection on alternative alleles, whereby the fitness of each decreases as its frequency increases(4,5). Examples of frequency-dependent selection are rare, especially when attempting to describe the genetic basis of the phenotype under selection. Here we show frequency-dependent selection in a well-known natural genetic polymorphism affecting fruitfly foraging behaviour. When raised in low nutrient conditions, both of the naturally occurring alleles of the foraging gene (for(s) and for(R)) have their highest fitness when rare - the hallmark of negative frequency-dependent selection. This effect disappears at higher resources levels, demonstrating the role of larval competition. We are able to confirm the involvement of the foraging gene by showing that a sitter-like mutant allele on a rover background has similar frequency-dependent fitness as the natural sitter allele. Our study represents a clear demonstration of frequency-dependent selection, and we are able to attribute this effect to a single, naturally polymorphic gene known to affect behaviour.},

   Abstract = {Females in a variety of species commonly mate with multiple males, and there is evidence that they benefit by producing offspring of higher genetic quality(1-3); however, the nature of these genetic benefits is debated(1-4). Enhanced offspring survival or quality can result from intrinsic effects of paternal genes- 'good genes'-or from interactions between the maternal and paternal genomes-'compatible genes'(1-5). Evidence for the latter process is accumulating(2,6): matings between relatives lead to decreased reproductive success, and the individual level of inbreeding-measured as average heterozygosity-is a strong fitness predictor(7-13). Females should thus benefit from mating with genetically dissimilar males(2,14). In many birds, social monogamy restricts mate choice, but females may circumvent this by pursuing extra-pair copulations(15,16). Here we show that female blue tits, Parus caeruleus, increase the heterozygosity of their progeny through extra-pair matings. Females thereby produce offspring of higher reproductive value, because less inbred individuals have increased survival chances, a more elaborate male secondary sexual trait (crown colour) and higher reproductive success. The cost of inbreeding may therefore be an important factor driving the evolution of female extra-pair mating.},

   Abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts the depletion of genetic variation in natural populations as a result of the effects of selection, but genetic variation is nevertheless abundant for many traits that are under directional or stabilizing selection(1). Evolutionary geneticists commonly try to explain this paradox with mechanisms that lead to a balance between mutation and selection(2). However, theoretical predictions of equilibrium genetic variance under mutation-selection balance are usually lower than the observed values, and the reason for this is unknown(3). The potential role of sexually antagonistic selection in maintaining genetic variation has received little attention in this debate, surprisingly given its potential ubiquity in dioecious organisms. At fitness-related loci, a given genotype may be selected in opposite directions in the two sexes. Such sexually antagonistic selection will reduce the otherwise-expected positive genetic correlation between male and female fitness(4). Both theory(5-7) and experimental data(8-12) suggest that males and females of the same species may have divergent genetic optima, but supporting data from wild populations are still scarce(13-15). Here we present evidence for sexually antagonistic fitness variation in a natural population, using data from a long-term study of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We show that male red deer with relatively high fitness fathered, on average, daughters with relatively low fitness. This was due to a negative genetic correlation between estimates of fitness in males and females. In particular, we show that selection favours males that carry low breeding values for female fitness. Our results demonstrate that sexually antagonistic selection can lead to a trade-off between the optimal genotypes for males and females; this mechanism will have profound effects on the operation of selection and the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations.},

I show that large males are successful in male- male competition, but contrary to what one would expect, dominants are not preferred by females and are not better at taking care of the eggs. Female preference, however, correlated with the subsequent hatching success of the eggs. Thus, female choice selects for good parenting. Hence, direct benefits in the form of superior paternal care can explain female choice in this species, supporting a good parent process of sexual selection. However, choosing on the outcome of male-male competition does not enable females to mate with the 'best' males.},

We conducted a large number of mate choice trials involving unmanipulated stimulus males, and found low but significant consistency (repeatability of time allocation by a female tested twice with the same set of males R = 0.29), and very low but significant between-female agreement (different females tested with the same set of males: R = 0.11). Although low individual consistency indicates that preferences were relatively weak or hard to measure, we found significant repeatability of individual preference functions with regard to beak colour, song rate and male aggressiveness when individual females were tested twice with different sets of males. This means that some females consistently preferred red-beaked males whereas others preferred orange-beaked males, some preferred high and others low song rates, and some preferred aggressive and others less aggressive males. Of these male traits, only song rate was positively related to average male attractiveness. Low between-female agreement did not seem to result from assortative mating for quality, because there was no repeatability of an individual female's preference for attractive or unattractive males. It is possible that disagreement follows from choice for genetic compatibility, but much of it could also result from weak preferences and little variation in male quality.

We also found that daughters differed in their choosiness during mate-choice experiments depending on whether they originated from eggs produced early or late within the laying sequence of a clutch. Because this effect of laying order occurred independently of hatching order in cross-fostered broods, it must have been caused by consistent within-mother variation in maternal effects transmitted through the egg. Our findings raise the question whether these maternal effects might represent strategic programming of offspring behavior in response to the environment experienced by mothers or whether they are merely nonadaptive byproducts of developmental processes.},

   Abstract = {A recent study on a captive zebra finch population suggested that variation in digit ratio (i.e. the relative length of the second to the fourth toe) might be an indicator of the action of sex steroids during embryo development, as is widely assumed for human digits. Zebra finch digit ratio was found to vary with offspring sex, laying order of eggs within a clutch, and to predict aspects of female mating behaviour. Hence, it was proposed that the measurement of digit ratio would give insights into how an individual's behaviour is shaped by its maternal environment. Studying 500 individuals of a different zebra finch population I set out to: (1) determine the proximate causes of variation in digit ratio by means of quantitative genetics and (2) to search for phenotypic and genetic correlations between digit ratio, sexual behaviour and aspects of fitness. In contrast to the earlier study, I found no sexual dimorphism in digit ratio and no effect of either laying order or experimentally altered hatching order on digit ratio. Instead, I found that variation in digit ratio was almost entirely additive genetic, with heritability estimates ranging from 71 to 84%. The rearing environment (from egg deposition to independence) explained an additional 5-6% of the variation in digit ratio, but there was no indication of any maternal effects transmitted through the egg. I found highly significant phenotypic correlations (and genetic correlations of similar size) between digit ratio and male song rate (positive correlation) as well as between digit ratio and female hopping activity in a choice chamber (negative correlation). Rather surprisingly, the strength of these correlations differed significantly between subsequent generations of the same population, illustrating how quickly such correlations can appear and disappear probably due to genotype-environment interactions.},

   Abstract = {A general framework is presented to unify diverse models of natural selection. This framework is based on the Price Equation, with two additional steps. First, characters are described by their multiple regression on a set of predictor variables. The most common predictors in genetics are alleles and their interactions, but any predictor may be used. The second step is to describe fitness by multiple regression on characters. Once again, characters may be chosen arbitrarily. This expanded Price Equation provides an exact description of total evolutionary change under all conditions, and for all systems of inheritance and selection. The model is first used for a new proof of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. The relations are then made clear among Fisher's theorem, Robertson's covariance theorem for quantitative genetics, the Lande-Arnold model for the causal analysis of natural selection, and Hamilton's rule for kin selection. Each of these models is a partial analysis of total evolutionary change. The Price Equation extends each model to an exact, total analysis of evolutionary change for any system of inheritance and selection. This exact analysis is used to develop an expanded Hamilton's rule for total change. The expanded rule clarifies the distinction between two types of kin selection coefficients. The first measures components of selection caused by correlated phenotypes of social partners. The second measures components of heritability via transmission by direct and indirect components of fitness.},

To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation, lambda, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic dependence, and 60% of characters overall (pooled across studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16% of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how this may be done.},

   Abstract = {The mixed-model factorial analysis of variance has been used in many recent studies in evolutionary quantitative genetics. Two competing formulations of the mixed-model ANOVA are commonly used, the "Scheffe" model and the 'SAS' model; these models differ in both their assumptions and in the way in which variance components due to the main effect of random factors are defined. The biological meanings of the two variance component definitions have often been unappreciated, however. A full understanding of these meanings leads to the conclusion that the mixed-model ANOVA could have been used to much greater effect by many recent authors. The variance component due to the random main effect under the two-way SAS model is the covariance in true means associated with a level of the random factor (e,g., families) across levels of the fixed factor (e.g., environments). Therefore the SAS model has a natural application for estimating the genetic correlation between a character expressed in different environments and testing whether it differs from zero. The variance component due to the random main effect under the two-way Scheffe model is the variance in marginal means (i.e., means over levels of the fixed factor) among levels of the random factor. Therefore the Scheffe model has a natural application for estimating genetic variances and heritabilities in populations using a defined mixture of environments. Procedures and assumptions necessary for these applications of the models are discussed. While exact significance tests under the SAS model require balanced data and the assumptions that family effects are normally distributed with equal variances in the different environments, the model can be useful even when these conditions are not met (e.g., for providing an unbiased estimate of the across- environment genetic covariance). Contrary to statements in a recent paper, exact significance tests regarding the variance in marginal means as well as unbiased estimates can be readily obtained from unbalanced designs with no restrictive assumptions about the distributions or variance-covariance structure of family effects.},

   Abstract = {Individual growth rate of animals is increasingly used as an indicator of ecological stressors. Environmental contaminants often affect physiological processes within individuals, which in turn affect the animal's growth rate. Consequently, there is an increasing need to estimate parameters in physiologically based individual growth models. Here, we present a method for estimating parameters in an energetic-based individual growth model (a dynamic energy budget model). This model is a system of stochastic differential equations in which one of the state variables (the energy reserve) is unobservable. There is no analytical solution to the probability density of size at given age, so we use a numerical nonlinear state-space method to calculate the likelihood. An algorithm to calculate the likelihood is outlined in this paper. This method is general enough to apply to other stochastic differential equation models. We assessed the estimability of parameters in the individual growth model, and analyzed size trajectory data from delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). We expect this method to become an important tool in ecological studies as computers become faster, as the models that we deal with become more complex, and as the data that we collect become more detailed.},

   Abstract = {Determining the degree to which variation in traits is controlled by genetics and/or environment is fundamental to understanding adaptation. In this study, we examine the genetic and environmental influences on color pattern expression in male bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei. This is a compelling system because both male color patterns and vision physiology are correlated with basic properties of the environment. Across populations, males with blue anal fins are more abundant in waters with low transmission of UV and blue wavelengths. Here, we present results from two paternal half-sib breeding experiments (one in the laboratory, one in the greenhouse) in which offspring were raised under light treatments that mimicked natural variation in the spectral composition of light. In both experiments, we found that red-versus-yellow expression is controlled by an autosomal locus of large effect where yellow (Y) is dominant over red (y). There was little blue expression in the laboratory. In the greenhouse, we found higher expression of blue anal fin morphs when males were raised in tea-stained water (low transmission UV/ blue) than when raised in clear water (high transmission UV/blue). We also found genetic effects of sires and an interaction between sire and lighting environment (i.e. heritable plasticity). These results show that a relatively simple, environmentally dependent, epistatic interaction can produce a large amount of variation in male color patterns that presumably function in sexual selection.},

Sire (i.e. genetic) effects were present for opsin found in yellow photopigment. Dam effects were present for opsins that create violet, blue and red photopigment. Lighting conditions affected expression of all opsins except SWS2A and mimicked the pattern found among populations.

   Abstract = {The sensory bias model of sexual selection posits that female mating preferences are by-products of natural selection on sensory systems. Although sensory bias was proposed 20 years ago, its critical assumptions remain untested. This paradox arises because sensory bias has been used to explain two different phenomena. First, it has been used as a hypothesis about signal design, that is, that males evolve traits that stimulate female sensory systems. Second, sensory bias has been used as a hypothesis for the evolution of female preference itself, that is, to explain why females exhibit particular preferences. We focus on this second facet. First, we clarify the unique features of sensory bias relative to the alternative models by considering each in the same quantitative genetic framework. The key assumptions of sensory bias are that natural selection is the predominant evolutionary mechanism that affects preference and that sexual selection on preferences is quantitatively negligible. We describe four studies that would test these assumptions and review what we can and cannot infer about sensory bias from existing studies. We suggest that the importance of sensory bias as an explanation for the evolution of female preferences remains to be determined.},

We quantified error rates using the comparable results of 791 single shed hair PCR amplifications of 11 microsatellite loci of 18 known individuals. The most frequent error was the amplification of only one of the two alleles present at a heterozygous locus. This phenomenon, called allelic dropout, produced false homozygotes in 31% of single-hair amplifications. There was no difference in the probability of preferential amplification between longer and shorter alleles. The probability of scoring false homozygotes can be reduced to below 0.05 by three separate amplifications from single hairs of the same individual or by pooling hair samples from the same individual. In this study an additional 5.6% of the amplifications gave wrong genotypes because of contamination, labelling and loading errors, and possibly amplification artefacts. In contrast, amplifications from plucked hair taken from four dead individuals gave consistent results (error rate < 0.01%, n = 120). Allelic dropout becomes a problem when the DNA concentration falls below 0.05 ng/10 PL in the template as it can with shed hair, and extracts from faeces and masticated plant matter.},

The potential for the swift evolution of virulence in response to changes in host ecology has motivated the integration of evolutionary ecology with epidemiological theory, as part of the emerging field of evolutionary epidemiology. Virulence is the product of complex interactions among evolutionary, ecological and epidemiological processes. Recent models that incorporate ideas from both evolutionary ecology and epidemiology generate predictions that could not be made by either discipline alone. These models predict that the ecological or evolutionary changes affecting population dynamics of disease, such as spatial structuring, within-host dynamics, polymorphism in host resistance, host longevity and population size, impose selection on virulence. As disease incidence increases, it becomes particularly important to take into account the implications of infection by multiple parasite strains. Evolutionary epidemic models also identify the potential importance of immune evasion and optimal virulence for the selection of sex in parasites. Thus, merging epidemiology with evolutionary ecology has widespread potential to help us answer evolutionary questions and to guide public health policy.},

   Abstract = {Despite great interest in sexual selection, relatively little is known in detail about the genetic and environmental determinants of secondary sexual characters in natural populations. Such information is important for determining the way in which populations may respond to sexual selection. We report analyses of genetic and large-scale environmental components of phenotypic variation of two secondary sexual plumage characters (forehead and wing patch size) in the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis over a 22-year period. We found significant heritability for both characters but little genetic covariance between the two. We found a positive association between forehead patch size and a large-scale climatic index, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, but not for wing patch. This pattern was observed in both cross- sectional and longitudinal data suggesting that the population response to NAO index can be explained as the result of phenotypic plasticity. Heritability of forehead patch size for old males, calculated under favorable conditions (NAO index greater than or equal to median), was greater than that under unfavorable conditions (NAO index < median). These changes occurred because there were opposing changes in additive genetic variance (V-A) and residual variance (V-R) under favorable and unfavorable conditions, with V-A increasing and V-R decreasing in good environments. However, no such effect was detected for young birds, or for wing patch size in either age class. In addition to these environmental effects on both phenotypic and genetic variances, we found evidence for a significant decrease of forehead patch size over time in older birds. This change appears to be caused by a change in the sign of viability selection on forehead patch size, which is associated with a decline in the breeding value of multiple breeders. Our data thus reveal complex patterns of environmental influence on the expression of secondary sexual characters, which may have important implications for understanding selection and evolution of these characters.},

We combined an "animal model" analysis with 36 years of data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major) to explore selection on and evolution of a morphological trait: body mass at fledging. We found significant heritability of this trait, but despite consistent positive directional selection on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic component of body mass, the population mean phenotypic value declined rather than increased over time. However, the mean breeding value for body mass at fledging increased over time, presumably in response to selection. We show that the divergence between the response to selection observed at the levels of genotype and phenotype can be explained by a change in environmental conditions over time, that is, related both to increased spring temperature before breeding and elevated population density. Our results support the suggestion that measuring phenotypes may not always give a reliable impression of evolutionary trajectories and that understanding patterns of phenotypic evolution in nature requires an understanding of how the environment has itself changed.},

Furthermore, if dispersal is non-random it may actually reinforce, rather than counteract, evolutionary differentiation. Here we document the evolution of differences in body mass within a population of great tits, Parus major, inhabiting a single continuous woodland, over a 36-year period. We show that genetic variance for nestling body mass is spatially variable, that this generates different potential responses to selection, and that this diversifying effect is reinforced by non-random dispersal. Matching the patterns of variation, selection and evolution with population ecological data, we argue that the small-scale differentiation is driven by density-related differences in habitat quality affecting settlement decisions. Our data show that when gene flow is not homogeneous, evolutionary differentiation can be rapid and can occur over surprisingly small spatial scales. Our findings have important implications for questions of the scale of adaptation and speciation, and challenge the usual treatment of dispersal as a force opposing evolutionary differentiation.},

Despite their great appeal and potential, the optimal use of molecular tools is still debated and it remains unclear how they should best be used to obtain reliable estimates of evolutionary parameters in the wild.

Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass-corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade.

   Abstract = {Evolutionary change requires natural selection in the presence of heritable variation for the trait(s) under selection. Since heritabilities and selection pressures are known to vary with environmental conditions, it is crucial to know how much genetic variation is expressed under which conditions. This study addresses the question of how the expression of genetic variation for fledgling body size of Great Tits varies with the environment. Different environmental conditions were created experimentally by manipulating brood sizes. The treatment affected body size, measured as either fledging weight or tarsus length, and interacted with natural temporal variation in food availability. Both measurements show stabilizing selection. A cross-fostering design was carried out to separate genetic and environmental causes of variation. Heritabilities as measured from offspring-midparent regressions and from full- sib analyses were substantial for both traits, except that no heritability was found for weight under poor conditions. Instead, fledging weights were significantly correlated with the weights of their unrelated guardians' (= fosterparents') weight under poor conditions. We propose that under poor conditions, when selection on fledging weights is expected to be directional and strong, only little genetic variance is expressed. Any evolutionary response to this selection on fledging weight might therefore be slow, if the increase in selection pressure is not greater than the decrease in heritability.},

   Abstract = {This study investigated genetic variation in growth and final size in relationship to differences in heritabilities under good and poor feeding conditions. Heritabilities of growth and final size were estimated for several traits under ad libitum and restricted feeding conditions. A 30 % feed restriction from hatching to 44 days of age in Japanese quail chicks decreased body weight and tarsus length at 44 days of age and the length of the third primary covert feather at 24 days of age relative to controls fed ad libitum. Wing length at 44 days of age was not significantly different for ad libitum fed and restricted quail. Genetic variances for body weight and tarsus length were very large throughout growth which resulted in heritability estimates close to one for these traits. The genetic correlations among feeding treatments were low, indicating that different genes were affecting growth under the two treatments. Growth was described by the components: asymptote, growth period, and shape of the growth curve following the modified Richards growth curve model (Brisbin et al. 1986). Tarsus length, which had high heritability of the parameter 'growth period' of the model, tended to display a higher heritability under the restriction than under ad libitum feeding. Body weight and feather length, which had either no heritable or low heritable 'growth periods' estimates, tended to be more heritable under ad libitum feeding. The shape parameter of the growth curve was not heritable for any trait, except tarsus length under restricted feeding.},

   Abstract = {It is widely accepted that a requirement for honest handicap signalling is that higher-quality signallers pay lower marginal costs for advertising. This is a simple, powerful principle, but it is correct only if the fitness effects of fecundity and viability are strictly additive. Additivity would not be expected from most life history models. The general criterion for honest handicap signalling is that higher-quality signallers must have higher marginal fitness effects of advertising. This might result from higher benefits rather than lower costs. The general criterion implies the existence of a ridge on the fitness surface for two correlated characters, quality (or viability) and advertising. This has important implications for the design of experiments. Critical tests of the handicap hypothesis should establish that signallers of different quality are on a rising fitness ridge because of different cost-benefit trade-offs. The further question of whether receivers are maximizing their fitness requires additional experiments because handicap signalling does not require that the receivers maximize their fitness, only that they return benefits to signallers as an increasing function of the size of the signal. If receiver preferences are exaggerated by sensory bias or indirect selection, the resulting exaggerated signals may be consistent with the handicap principle.

   Abstract = {The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis, that parasite-host coevolution can maintain heritable variation in fitness, has inspired a very successful research program on sexual selection on signals of health. The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was developed to provide a handicapping mechanism to stabilize the correlation between signals and health. In earlier articles, I showed that handicap signaling is a special case, not a general law that we can rely on to deduce relative costs across signalers of different quality at equilibrium. The essential requirement for reliable signaling is that higher-quality signalers are more efficient; they get greater marginal fitness returns from an incremental increase in the signal. This does not undermine the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence mechanism, but it does raise doubts about a widespread assumption that is commonly used to test these hypotheses: that sexual selection on signals of health implies the choice of mates with the fewest parasites. Immunity and parasites might play a fundamental role in many biological signaling systems, but viability-indicating traits are not necessarily parasite-load-indicating traits. Theory allows for the possibility that high-quality big signalers have greater health and more parasites than low-quality small signalers (and the data suggest that in many systems they do). This means that we cannot test the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis by counting parasites. More generally, we cannot understand sexual selection on signals of health by focusing on the viability costs of signals.},

   Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC; the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) has been used for many statistical problems, including Bayesian inference, likelihood inference, and tests of significance. Though the method generally works well, doubts about convergence often remain. Here we propose MCMC methods distantly related to simulated annealing. Our samplers mix rapidly enough to be usable for problems in which other methods would require eons of computing time. They simulate realizations from a sequence of distributions, allowing the distribution being simulated to vary randomly over time. If the sequence of distributions is well chosen, then the sampler will mix well and produce accurate answers for all the distributions. Even when there is only one distribution of interest, these annealing-like samplers may be the only known way to get a rapidly mixing sampler. These methods are essential for attacking very hard problems, which arise in areas such as statistical genetics. We illustrate the methods with an application that is much harder than any problem previously done by MCMC, involving ancestral inference on a very large genealogy (7 generations, 2,024 individuals). The problem is to find, conditional on data on living individuals, the probabilities of each individual having been a carrier of cystic fibrosis. Exact calculation of these conditional probabilities is infeasible. Moreover, a Gibbs sampler for the problem would not mix in a reasonable time, even on the fastest imaginable computers. Our annealing-like samplers have mixing times of a few hours. We also give examples of samplers for the ''witch's hat'' distribution and the conditional Strauss process.},

   Abstract = {Multivariate models are of great importance in theoretical and applied quantitative genetics. We extend quantitative genetic theory to accommodate situations in which there is linear feedback or recursiveness between the phenotypes involved in a multivariate system, assuming an infinitesimal, additive, model of inheritance. It is shown that structural parameters defining a simultaneous or recursive system have a bearing on the interpretation of quantitative genetic parameter estimates (e.g., heritability, offspring-parent regression, genetic correlation) when such features are ignored. Matrix representations are given for treating a plethora of feedback- recursive situations. The likelihood function is derived, assuming multivariate normality, and results from econometric theory for parameter identification are adapted to a quantitative genetic setting. A Bayesian treatment with a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation is suggested for inference and developed. When the system is fully recursive, all conditional posterior distributions are in closed form, so Gibbs sampling is straightforward. If there is feedback, a Metropolis step may be embedded for sampling the structural parameters, since their conditional distributions are unknown. Extensions of the model to discrete random variables and to nonlinear relationships between phenotypes are discussed.},

To test this prediction in D. melanogaster, we sampled, and cytogenetically cloned, 20 X chromosomes and compared their fitness variation to genome-wide levels. At the juvenile stage, in which gender roles are most similar, the X chromosome made no detectable contribution to genome-wide fitness variation. At the adult stage, in which gender roles diverge, the X chromosome was estimated to harbour 45% of the genome-wide fitness variation and 97% of the genome-wide sexually antagonistic variation. This genomic structure has important implications for the process of sexual selection because X-linked sexually antagonistic variation contributes to negative intersexual heritability for fitness, i.e. high-fitness males (females) produce, on average, low-fitness daughters (sons).},

We tested this hypothesis using a long-term dataset from a Dutch great tit (Parus major) population. Although there was strong selection for earlier breeding in this population, egg-laying dates have changed only marginally over the last decades. Using a so-called animal model, we quantified the additive genetic variance in breeding time and predicted breeding values for females. Subsequently, we compared selection at the phenotypic and genetic levels for two fitness components, fecundity and adult survival. We found no evidence for an environmentally caused covariance between breeding time and fitness or counteracting selection on the different fitness components. Consequently, breeding time should respond to selection but the expected response to selection was too small to be detected.},

   Abstract = {An extraordinarily large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are now available in humans as well as in other model organisms. Technological advancements may soon make it feasible to assay hundreds of SNPs in virtually any organism of interest. One potential application of SNPs is the determination of pairwise genetic relationships in populations without known pedigrees. Although microsatellites are currently the marker of choice for this purpose, the number of independently segregating microsatellite markers that can be feasibly assayed is limited. Thus, it can be difficult to distinguish reliably some classes of relationship (e.g. full- sibs from half-sibs) with microsatellite data alone. We assess, via Monte Carlo computer simulation, the potential for using a large panel of independently segregating SNPs to infer genetic relationships, following the analytical approach of Blouin et al . (1996). We have explored a 'best case scenario' in which 100 independently segregating SNPs are available. For discrimination among single-generation relationships or for the identification of parent-offspring pairs, it appears that such a panel of moderately polymorphic SNPs (minor allele frequency of 0.20) will provide discrimination power equivalent to only 16-20 independently segregating microsatellites. Although newly available analytical methods that can account for tight genetic linkage between markers will, in theory, allow improved estimation of relationships using thousands of SNPs in highly dense genomic scans, in practice such studies will only be feasible in a handful of model organisms. Given the comparable amount of effort required for the development of both types of markers, it seems that microsatellites will remain the marker of choice for relationship estimation in nonmodel organisms, at least for the foreseeable future.},

   Abstract = {Classical life-history theory predicts 'trade-offs' between reproductive and somatic investments. However, empirical studies have shown that intraspecific phenotypic correlations between these two resource investments are often positive or nonsignificant, rather than negative as predicted. The model of Van Noordwijk and De Jong (1986) was proposed to explain these unexpected results. According to their model, positive correlations between reproductive and somatic investments will result if individual variation in resource acquisition exceeds that of resource allocation, whereas negative correlations will result if individual variation in resource allocation exceeds that of resource acquisition. To test this model, I used body storage/condition as an index of somatic investment because it is usually strongly related to level of resource acquisition. I predicted that laboratory studies should more often show negative correlations between reproductive and somatic investments than field studies, because individual variation in resource acquisition is expected to be lower in controlled laboratory environments than in variable natural environments. A literature review revealed that correlations between somatic (storage) investment and reproductive investment (estimated as clutch/litter mass, number of offspring per clutch/litter, or number of clutches/litters) among conspecific breeding female animals are more often positive (15 species) or nonsignificant (17 species) than negative (6 species). Moreover, as expected, five of six negative correlations were observed in laboratory studies, whereas 13 of 15 positive correlations were observed in field studies. It is concluded that future empirical and theoretical work on life histories should consider individual variation in both resource acquisition and allocation and the interaction between the two.},

This allocation-priority hypothesis explains why life-history traits, such as those involving growth and reproduction, generally have lower heritabilities than higher-priority morphological and physiological traits related to body maintenance.

   Abstract = {Rainforests offer two contrasted light environments: a bright canopy rich in blue and UV and a dark understorey, rich in green and orange. Therefore, natural selection for crypsis should favour dark brown signals in understorey and bright green signals in canopy, whereas sexual selection for conspicuousness should favour bright yellow-red signals in understorey and dark blue and UV signals in canopy. Using spectrometry and comparative analyses, we examined the relationship between ambient light and colour signals in a bird community of French Guiana. It appears that brightness and hue are mostly naturally selected, while UV content of plumage is more likely sexually selected. At each height, both sexes present similar coloration but males display more conspicuous sexually selected patterns than females. These results show that ambient light drives the evolution of colour signals at community scale, and should be considered when studying signalling in other communities and light-contrasted ecosystems.},

   Abstract = {The analysis of presence-absence matrices with "null model" randomization tests has been a major source of controversy in community ecology for over two decades. In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Conner and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do nut co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not. greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic "island lists" of species in an archipelago or standardized "sample lists" of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

In the analysis of biodiversity, ecologists have used random sampling procedures such as rarefaction to adjust for differences in abundance and sampling effort. In the analysis of species co-occurrence and assembly rules, null models have been used to detect the signature of species interactions. However, controversy persists over the details of computer algorithms used for randomizing presence-absence matrices. Finally, in the newly emerging discipline of macroecology, null models can be used to identify constraining boundaries in bivariate scatterplots of variables such as body size, range size, and population density. Null models provide specificity and flexibility in data analysis that is often not possible with conventional statistical tests.},

Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Diamond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance.

Presence-absence matrices for small-bodied taxa with low vagility and/or small populations (marine ectoparasites, herps) were mostly random, whereas presence-absence matrices for large-bodied taxa with high vagility and/or large populations (birds, mammals) were highly structures.

Because gene frequency changes underly adaptation, this can lead to a suspicion that approaches ignoring these sophistications are approximate or tentative or wrong. Stochastic environments and sexual selection are two topics in which there are widespread views that focusing on number of offspring of individuals is not enough, and that proper treatments require the introduction of further details, namely variability in offspring number and linkage disequilibrium, respectively. However, the bulk of empirical research on adaptation and a great deal of theoretical work continue to employ these approaches. Here, a new theoretical development arising from the Price equation provides a formal justification in very general circumstances for focusing on the arithmetic average of the relative number of offspring of individuals.},

Geospiza fortis bred with G. scandens and G. fuliginosa. Although interbreeding was always rare (< 5%), sufficient samples of measurements of hybrids and backcrosses were accumulated for analysis. Five beak and body dimensions and mass were measured, and from these two synthetic (principal-component) traits were constructed. All traits were heritable in two of the interbreeding species (G. fuliginosa were too rare to be analyzed) and in the combined samples of F- 1 hybrids and backcrosses to G. fortis. In agreement with expectations from a model of polygenic inheritance, hybrid and backcross classes were generally phenotypically intermediate between the breeding groups that had produced them. Hybridization increased additive genetic and environmental variances, increased heritabilities to a moderate extent, and generally strengthened phenotypic and genetic correlations. New additive genetic variance introduced by hybridization is estimated to be two to three orders of magnitude greater than that introduced by mutation. Enhanced variation facilitates directional evolutionary change, subject to constraints arising from genetic correlations between characters. The Darwin's finch data suggest that these constraints become stronger when species with similar proportions hybridize, but some become weaker when the interbreeding species have different allometries. This latter effect of hybridization, together with an enhancement of genetic variation, facilitates evolutionary change in a new direction.},

   Abstract = {Microevolution of quantitative traits in the wild can be predicted from a knowledge of selection and genetic parameters. Testing the predictions requires measurement of the offspring of the selected group, a requirement that is difficult to meet. We present the results of a study of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos island of Daphne Major where this requirement is met. The study demonstrates microevolutionary consequences of natural selection. The population of medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, experienced size-selective mortality during a drought in 1976-1977; large birds with deep beaks survived better than small birds. During another drought, 1984-1986, the population experienced selection in the opposite direction on beak traits. Changes in food supply were the apparent causes of selection on beak traits in both episodes. As expected from the high heritabilities of all measured traits, the effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation. Evolutionary responses to both episodes of selection were quantitatively well predicted in general. This allows us to conclude that, to a first approximation, targets of selection were identified correctly, and genetic parameters were correctly estimated. Nevertheless, not all responses of individual traits were equally well predicted. A search for possible reasons for the largest discrepancies revealed evidence of bias caused by environmental effects on growth and adult size of some traits, as well as possible selection on the offspring generation before their measurement. These findings illustrate an important assumption in the study of microevolution: that the environments experienced during growth to maturity by the parental and offspring generations are the same, for otherwise a measured difference between generations may have a partly environmental cause, thereby giving a misleading estimate of the evolutionary response to selection. Simple extrapolations from observed selection to long-term evolution may underestimate the total force of selection involved if it oscillates in direction or acts on the environmental variance.},

   Abstract = {The process of speciation in birds can be inferred from the pattern of diversification on islands, especially in archipelagos. The basic model is one of initial differentiation of allopatric populations, with further differentiation taking place at the time that sympatry is established. Differences that evolve in allopatry are reinforced by a regime of divergent selection on the taxa in sympatry arising from ecological pressures and not from reproductive (genetic) incompatibility. A low level of interbreeding (hybridization) at the secondary contact phase and subsequently may occur with little or no fitness loss. Introgressive hybridization has the potential to play a creative role in evolution, facilitating further divergence by enhancing genetic variation and relaxing genetic constraints on particular directions of evolutionary change under natural selection. Hybridization potential may last for many millions of years after two taxa diverge, implying that post-zygotic isolation evolves slowly. The main alternative model of speciation in island birds is the peripatric model. It emphasizes major genetic changes taking place in the founding of a new population by a small number of individuals. There is no direct evidence that would make it preferable to the standard allopatric model for islands.},

Natural selection occurred frequently in both species and varied from unidirectional to oscillating, episodic to gradual. Hybridization occurred repeatedly though rarely, resulting in elevated phenotypic variances in G. scandens and a change in beak shape.

In habitats with limited good-quality nesting cover, the dullest and the brightest yearlings were more successful in obtaining high- quality territories, pairing with females and siring offspring, than yearlings with intermediate plumage. This pattern reflects the way that territorial adult males vary levels of aggression to influence the structure of their social neighbourhood. Adult males showed less aggression towards dull yearlings than intermediate and bright ones, permitting the dull yearlings to settle on good territories nearby. Fitness comparisons based on paternity analyses showed that both the adults and dull yearlings benefited genetically from this arrangement, revealing a rare example of sexually selected male-male cooperation(5,6).},

We showed that carotenoid availability in the wild limits the expression of sexual coloration in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a species in which females prefer males with brighter orange carotenoid-containing spots.

   Abstract = {Under the indicator models of mate choice, female preferences evolve to exploit the condition-dependence or "indicator value" of male traits, which in turn may cause these traits to evolve to elaborate extremes. If the indicator value of a male trait changes, the payoff function of the female preference for that trait should change and the preference should evolve to a new optimum. I tested this prediction in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a species in which the indicator value of a sexually selected male trait, carotenoid coloration, varies geographically. Carotenoid coloration is thought to be an indicator of foraging ability and health because animals must obtain carotenoid pigments from their diet. The primary dietary source of carotenoids for guppies is unicellular algae, the abundance of which varies among natural streams because of variation in forest canopy cover. Carotenoid availability limits male coloration to a greater extent in streams with greater forest canopy cover. Thus, the indicator value of male coloration covaries positively with canopy cover. To test the indicator model prediction, I measured genetic divergence in the strength of female preferences for carotenoid coloration between high- and low-carotenoid availability streams in each of three river drainages. Second-generation laboratory-born females were given a choice between full-sib males raised on three different dietary levels of carotenoids. For all six populations, male attractiveness (as determined from the responses of females to male courtship displays) increased with dietary carotenoid levels. However, the strength of female preferences differed between populations in the predicted direction in only one of three river drainages. These results fail to support a crucial prediction of the indicator model. More studies taking an interpopulation approach to studying mate preference evolution are needed before the explanatory value of the indicator models can be rigorously assessed.},

   Abstract = {Carotenoid-based sexual coloration is the classic example of an honest signal of mate quality Animals cannot synthesize carotenoid pigments and ultimately depend on dietary sources. Thus, in carotenoid-poor environments, carotenoid coloration may be a direct indicator of foraging ability and an indirect indicator of health and vigour. Carotenoid coloration may also be affected, more directly, by parasites in some species. Carotenoids are not, however:, the only conspicuous pigments available to animals. Pteridine pigments, with similar spectral properties, are displayed in the exoskeletons and wings of insects, the irides of birds and the skins of fishes, lizards and amphibians. Unlike carotenoids, pteridines are synthesized de novo by animals. We report that the orange spots that male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) display to females contain red pteridine pigments (drosopterins) in addition to carotenoids. We also examined the relationship between drosopterin production by males and carotenoid availability in the field. The results contrasted sharply with the hypothesis that males use drosopterins to compensate for carotenoid scarcity: males used more, not less, drosopterins in streams with higher carotenoid availability The positive association between drosopterin use and carotenoid availability could reflect the costs of drosopterin synthesis or it could be a consequence of females preferring a particular pigment ratio or hue. Male guppies appear to use drosopterin pigments in a manner that dilutes, but does not eliminate, the indicator value of carotenoid coloration.},

   Abstract = {Rarely are the evolutionary origins of mate preferences known, but, recently, the preference of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) for males with carotenoid-based sexual coloration has been linked to a sensory bias that may have originally evolved for detecting carotenoid-rich fruits. If carotenoids enhance the immune systems of these fishes, as has been suggested for other species, this could explain the origin of the attraction to orange fruits as well as the maintenance of the female preference for orange males. We used the classic immunological technique of tissue grafting to assay a component of the immune response of guppies raised on two different dietary levels of carotenoids. Individual scales were transplanted between pairs of unrelated fishes, creating reciprocal allografts. Transplanted scales were scored on a six-point rejection scale every day for 10 days. Five days later, the same pairs of fishes received a second set of allografts and were scored again. Compared with low-carotenoid- diet males, high-carotenoid-diet males mounted a significantly stronger rejection response to the second allograft but not to the first allograft. High-carotenoid-diet females, however, showed no improvement in graft rejection compared with low- carotenoid-diet females. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for sex-specific effects of carotenoid consumption on the immune system of a species with carotenoid- based sexual coloration. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the mate preference for carotenoid coloration is maintained by the benefits to females of choosing healthy mates, but they cast doubt on the idea that the benefits of carotenoid consumption, per se, could account for the origin of the preference. The sex-specificity of carotenoid effects on allograft rejection in guppies provides indirect support for the general hypothesis that males pay an immunological cost for sexual ornamentation.},

   Abstract = {Colour patches are complex traits, the components of which may evolve independently through a variety of mechanisms. Although usually treated as simple, two-dimensional characters and classified as either structural or pigmentary, in reality colour patches are complicated, three-dimensional structures that often contain multiple pigment types and structural features. The basic dermal chromatophore unit of fishes, reptiles and amphibians consists of three contiguous ( ell layers. Xanthophores and crythrophores in the outermost layer contain carotenoid and pteridine pigments that absorb short- wave light iridophores in the middle layer contain crystalline platelets that reflect light back through the xanthophores; and melanophores in the basal layer contain melanins that absorb light across the spectrum. Changes in any one component of a chromatophore unit can drastically alter the reflectance spectrum produced, and for any given adaptive outcome (e.g. an increase in visibility), there may be multiple biochemical or cellular routes that evolution could take, allowing for divergent responses by different populations or species to similar selection regimes. All of the mechanisms of signal evolution that previously have been applied to single ornaments (including whole colour patches) could potentially be applied to the individual components of colour patches. To reach a complete understanding of colour patch evolution, however, it may be necessary to take all explicitly multi-trait approach. Here, we review multiple trait evolution theory and the basic mechanisms of colour production in fishes, reptiles and amphibians, and use a combination of computer simulation and empirical examples to show how multiple trait evolution theory can be applied to the components of single colour patches. This integrative perspective on animal colouration opens up a host of new questions and hypotheses. We offer specific, testable functional hypotheses for the most common pigmientary (carotenold, pteridine and melanin) and structural components of vertebrate colour patches.},

Many studies have shown that helpers typically provide care for relatives, but relatively few have shown that helpers provide closer kin with preferential care ( kin discrimination), fueling the suggestion that kin selection only poorly accounts for the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates. We used meta-analysis to show that (i) individuals consistently discriminate between kin, and (ii) stronger discrimination occurs in species where the benefits of helping are greater. These results suggest a general role for kin selection and that the relative importance of kin selection varies across species, as predicted by Hamilton's rule.},

   Abstract = {Models of sexual selection usually assume that variation in the expression of sexual ornaments is determined largely by genetic, rather than environmental, factors(1). However, empirical support for this assumption conies from studies of species with little parental care(1,2), in which the influence of environmental factors may be limited(3,4), and from studies of just two species(5,6) with parental care, in both of which heritability estimates vary hugely between years or populations(7,8). In the remaining studies of species with parental care, it is not known whether resemblance in sexual ornamentation between relatives was due to shared genes or shared patterns of care(3,4,9-15). Here we use cross-fostering experiments in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, to examine the relative roles of these effects. We demonstrate that, although sons resemble their fathers with respect to sexual ornamentation, this resemblance is mainly due to post-hatching environmental effects rather than shared genes. We also show that sons hatching early in the year have the largest ornaments. These results support models that emphasize the importance of environmental sources of variation(16-18), such as direct paternal effects(4,19,20), on the expression of sexual ornaments, and agree with the general observation that sexually selected traits tend to be condition dependent(1). We urge the incorporation of gene-environment interactions into future models of sexual selection.},

This study describes the analysis of the genetic mating system of two populations of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and uses the results from four other populations to test existing hypotheses using an intra-specific comparative approach. The parentage analysis was conducted using a combination of published and newly presented microsatellite loci isolated from the house sparrow. One population in Kentucky, U.S.A. was found to contain what may be considered to be a typical level of extra-pair paternity for this species (10.5%, 19/ 185 offspring). The second, a population on the island of Lundy, UK, exhibited a ver) low level (1.3%, 4/305 offspring), significantly lower than that in all the other populations studied so far. The finding of such diverse rates of extra-pair paternity, along with the existing estimates from other populations, has allowed us to test the effects of breeding density and genetic variation on the level of extra-pair paternity. We found no effect of either factor on the frequency of extra-pair paternity in the house sparrow, leaving the cause of this variation open to fresh ideas. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of London.},

   Pages = {987-993},
   Abstract = {There are numerous studies of between-individual variation in the expression of sexually selected traits, but relatively few of variation within individuals. We investigated within- individual variation, both between and within years, in the size of the sexually selected white forehead patch of the male collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. Patch size was determined from direct measurements of maximum height and width and by image analysis of photographs. Measures obtained by the two methods were highly correlated with each other. Male patch size showed significant repeatability both within and between years, but repeatability was lower for patch width than for patch height. Recent reanalysis of published data suggests that sexual selection acts mostly on the width of the patch rather than the height, suggesting that the component of patch size subject to sexual selection is most plastic. We found that, within individuals, forehead patch width changed in a predictable manner within years, becoming significantly smaller later in the breeding season. This effect was more pronounced in males with an initially larger patch. Patch size also changed predictably between years: males whose parental effort we manipulated experimentally showed corresponding changes in patch size between years, confirming an earlier finding from this population. Our results show that the size of sexually selected traits can vary within individuals, both in response to trade-offs with other life history traits, and also over short timescales. Such variation in the expression of sexually selected traits is important not only for the information it may provide about the processes controlling variation in such traits, but also because failure to account for it will reduce the accuracy of any attempt to quantify-selection on them.

Based on over 150 molecular genetic studies of EPP in birds, we review two topical areas: (i) ecological explanations for interspecific variation in the rate of EPP; and (ii) evidence bearing on the adaptive function of EPP. We highlight the remaining challenges of understanding the relative roles of genes and ecology in determining variation between taxa in the rate of extra paternity, and testing for differences between extra-pair offspring and those sired within-pair.},

In 2 of 3 years, we found that females paired to males with relatively brighter UV-coloration produced a greater proportion of sons in their broods, and that this effect was significant with all 3 years combined, despite a significant year by male UV interaction. In addition, we found other correlates of sex ratio (breeding time, female age and clutch size) in some, but not all years, and some of these showed significantly different relationships with sex ratio between years. In both years for which data were available, there were indications that males with relatively brighter UV coloration, and that paired with females that produced male- biased clutches, were more likely to survive to the next year. In addition, we also found that in both males and females, individuals produced similar sex ratios in consecutive years. Because correlations with the sex ratio may be expected to be weak, variation in results between years within the same population may be explained by low statistical power or genuine biological differences. Our results suggest that conclusions about sex ratio variation in birds should be based on multiple years. The correlations that we found in some years of this study are consistent with models of adaptive sex ratio adjustment in response to male quality. However, careful experimental work is required to provide tests of the assumptions of these models, and should be a priority for future work.},

The CHD-W gene is located on the W chromosome; therefore it is unique to females. The other gene, CHD-Z, is found on the Z chromosome and therefore occurs in both sexes (female, ZW; male, ZZ). The test employs PCR with a single set of primers. It amplifies homologous sections of both genes and incorporates introns whose lengths usually differ. When examined on a gel there is a single CHD-Z band in males but females have a second, distinctive CHD-W band.},

Similarly, maternal-effects theory has generally neglected the mechanisms by which mothers influence offspring phenotype. Although the environmental cues that generate maternal effects and the consequent effects for offspring phenotype are often well characterized, the intermediary physiological and developmental steps through which the maternal effect is transmitted are generally unknown. Integration of the proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody transmission with evolutionary theory on maternal effects affords an important opportunity to unite mechanism and process by focusing on the links between genetics, environment and physiology, with the ultimate goal of explaining differences among individuals and species in the transfer of immune function from one generation to the next.},

I simulated selection on genetic systems having different combinations of pleiotropic effects to investigate the variability of correlated responses to selection. The simulation shows that there are many possible combinations of pleiotropic effects that are characterized by the same value of the genetic correlation; the genetic correlation does not uniquely determine a set of pleiotropic effects. Furthermore, for a given value of the genetic correlation, differences in pleiotropic effects have a substantial impact on the variation in correlated responses. Some combinations of pleiotropic effects constrain correlated response to a narrow range of possible values; others allow a wide range, including some correlated responses in a direction opposite the sign of the genetic correlation. The genetic correlation is not a reliable predictor of pleiotropic constraint. Whereas it has been previously established that genetic correlations are not necessarily constraints, the alternative is also true: correlated response can be strictly constrained despite a genetic correlation of zero. Given the frequency of correlated responses in a direction opposite to the one predicted by the genetic correlation, it follows that correlated response is not a reliable predictor of genetic correlation in the base population.},

   Abstract = {In this article, a new class of functional models in which smoothing splines are used to model fixed effects as well as random effects is introduced. The linear mixed effects models are extended to non-parametric mixed effects models by introducing functional random effects, which are modeled as realizations of zero-mean stochastic processes. The fixed functional effects and the random functional effects are modeled in the sane functional space, which guarantee the population-average and subject-specific curves have the same smoothness property. These models inherit the flexibility of the linear mixed effects models in handling complex designs and correlation structures, can include continuous covariates as well as dummy factors in both the fixed or random design matrices, and include the nested curves models as special cases. Two estimation procedures are proposed. The first estimation procedure exploits the connection between linear mixed effects models and smoothing splines and can be fitted using existing software. The second procedure is a sequential estimation procedure using Kalman filtering. This algorithm avoids inversion of large dimensional matrices and therefore can be applied to large data sets. A generalized maximum likelihood (GML) ratio test is proposed for inference and model selection. An application to comparison of cortisol profiles is used as an illustration.},

   Abstract = {Evolutionary theory is primarily concerned with genetic processes, yet empirical testing of this theory often involves data collected on phenotypes. To make this tenable, the implicit assumption is often made that phenotypic patterns are good predictors of genetic patterns; an assumption that coined the phenotypic gambit. Although this assumption has been validated for traits with high heritability, such as morphology, its generality for traits with low heritabilities, such as life-history and behavioural traits, remains controversial. Using a large-scale cross-fostering experiment, we were able to measure genetic, common environmental and phenotypic correlations between four colour traits and two skeletal traits in a wild population of passerine birds, the blue tit (Parus caeruleus). Colour traits had little heritable variation but common environment effects were found to be important; skeletal traits showed the opposite pattern. Positive correlations because of a shared natal environment were found between all traits, obscuring negative genetic correlations between some colour and skeletal traits. Consequently, phenotypic patterns were poor surrogates for genetic patterns and we suggest that this may be common if trade-offs or substantial parental effects exist. For this group of traits, the phenotypic gambit cannot be made and we suggest caution when inferring genetic patterns from phenotypic data, especially for behavioural and life-history traits.},

   Abstract = {Some individuals die before a trait is measured or expressed ( the invisible fraction), and some relevant traits are not measured in any individual ( missing traits). This paper discusses how these concepts can be cast in terms of missing data problems from statistics. Using missing data theory, I show formally the conditions under which a valid evolutionary inference is possible when the invisible fraction and/or missing traits are ignored. These conditions are restrictive and unlikely to be met in even the most comprehensive long-term studies. When these conditions are not met, many selection and quantitative genetic parameters cannot be estimated accurately unless the missing data process is explicitly modelled. Surprisingly, this does not seem to have been attempted in evolutionary biology. In the case of the invisible fraction, viability selection and the missing data process are often intimately linked. In such cases, models used in survival analysis can be extended to provide a flexible and justified model of the missing data mechanism. Although missing traits pose a more difficult problem, important biological parameters can still be estimated without bias when appropriate techniques are used. This is in contrast to current methods which have large biases and poor precision. Generally, the quantitative genetic approach is shown to be superior to phenotypic studies of selection when invisible fractions or missing traits exist because part of the missing information can be recovered from relatives.},

   Abstract = {The oxygen store/usage hypothesis suggests that larger animals are able to dive for longer and hence deeper because oxygen storage scales isometrically with body mass, whereas oxygen usage scales allometrically with an exponent <1 (typically 0.67-0.75). Previous tests of the allometry of diving tend to reject this hypothesis, but they are based on restricted data sets or invalid statistical analyses (which assume that every species provides independent information). Here we apply information-theoretic statistical methods that are phylogenetically informed to a large data set on diving variables for birds and mammals to describe the allometry of diving. Body mass is strongly related to all dive variables except dive : pause ratio. We demonstrate that many diving variables covary strongly with body mass and that they have allometric exponents close to 0.33. Thus, our results fail to falsify the oxygen store/usage hypothesis. The allometric relationships for most diving variables are statistically indistinguishable for birds and mammals, but birds tend to dive deeper than mammals of equivalent mass. The allometric relationships for all diving variables except mean dive duration are also statistically indistinguishable for all major taxonomic groups of divers within birds and mammals, with the exception of the procellariiforms, which, strictly speaking, are not true divers.},

Demonstration of the procedure on three real experiments shows the potential for extracting important information available in the data that has, until now, been missed.

However, a number of empirical examinations have demonstrated that natural and sexual selection may act concurrently and in opposing directions. Other recent work has highlighted the difficulty of assigning fitness values for survival when reproduction and mortality within a population temporally overlap. I treat these as facets of a single problem; how to analyze selection where mortality and reproduction are concurrent. To address this problem, I formalize a method to estimate total fitness of individuals over a period of time utilizing longitudinal data. I then show how the fitness may be partitioned to provide two separate estimates of fitness for reproductive opportunity and reproductive success. In addition, another total fitness estimate for the period can be obtained from the two partitioned estimates. This procedure will allow calculation of total fitness where there are some missing datapoints for reproductive success of an individual. A simulation indicates that bias is generally low for the various fitness estimates. These methods should expand our ability to understand the interaction of different selection episodes.},

   Abstract = {As species evolve along a phylogenetic tree, we expect closely related species to retain some phenotypic similarities due to their shared evolutionary histories. The amount of expected similarity depends both on the hierarchical phylogenetic structure, and on the specific magnitude and types of evolutionary changes that accumulate during each generation. In this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the covariance structure expected from several simple microevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including various combinations of random genetic drift, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and environmental change, as well as models of punctuated or burst-like evolution. We find that stabilizing selection leads to patterns of exponential decrease of between species covariance with phylogenetic distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods. Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many processes in addition to random genetic drift, such as directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of punctuated change. Our framework can be used to develop methods for (1) phylogenetic reconstruction; (2) inference of the evolutionary process from comparative data; and (3) conducting or evaluating statistical analyses of comparative data while taking phylogenetic history into account.},

   Abstract = {Immune defences are undoubtedly of great benefit to the host, reducing the impact of infectious organisms. However, mounting immune responses also entails costs, which may be measured by inducing immune responses against artificial infections. We injected common eider (Somateria mollissima) females with three different non-pathogenic antigens, sheep red blood cells (SRBC), diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid, early in their incubation period. In the group of females that mounted a humoral immune response against SRBC, the return rate was only 27%, whereas the group of females that did not mount a response against SRBC had a return rate of 72%. Moreover, responding against diphtheria toxoid when also responding against SRBC led to a further reduction in return rate. These results are repeatable, as the same effect occurred independently in two study years. The severely reduced return rate of females producing antibodies against SRBC and diphtheria toxoid implies that these birds experienced considerably impaired long-term survival. This study thus documents severe costs of mounting humoral immune responses in a vertebrate. Such costs may explain why many organisms suppress immunity when under stress or when malnourished, and why infections may sometimes be tolerated without eliciting immune responses.},

Also, the degree of dispersal differed between cohorts, which shows that dispersal was partly conditionally dependent. The offspring to mid-parent estimate of heritability was 0.50. In a previous study of the same data set of male offspring, we did not detect associations between dispersal and several relevant environmental, parental and offspring condition factors. Thus, our results indicate that variation in dispersal partly has a genetic basis in great reed warblers.},

   Pages = {691-700},
   Abstract = {Cooperatively breeding birds tend to exhibit high adult survival and relatively small clutch sizes. According to the life-history hypothesis for cooperative breeding, high survival creates conditions for philopatry based on difficulties that dispersers face when competing for territories in a landscape with slow territory turnover. However, this hypothesis evokes a puzzle because high fecundity should also lead to problems in territory acquisition because of the large number of competitors for each vacancy. We suggest two reasons for the observed association between small clutch size, high survival rate and cooperative breeding in birds. The first reason is that when survival rate is a better predictor of cooperative breeding than fecundity, a general life-history trade-off between clutch size and survival rate will create the observed association between cooperative breeding and the two life- history characters. Theoretically, a high survival rate is expected to predict cooperative breeding better than fecundity, because a high survival rate increases both habitat saturation and the direct benefits of staying at home. The second reason is that the reproductive value of the first offspring each year is higher than that of subsequent offspring for cooperative breeders (the offspring depreciation hypothesis). This is because these offspring will be able to delay dispersal and gain indirect benefits by helping at home. We show that this. under very general conditions, decreases the optimum clutch size of cooperative breeders below that of non-cooperative breeders.},

   Abstract = {When several individuals simultaneously provide for offspring, as in families, the effort of any one individual will depend on the efforts of the other family members. This conflict of interest among family members is made more complicated by their relatedness because relatives share genetic interest to some degree. The conflict resolution will also be influenced by the differences in reproductive value between breeders and helpers. Here, we calculate evolutionarily stable provisioning efforts in families with up to two helpers. We explicitly consider that the behavioral choices are made in a life-history context, and we also consider how group sizes change dynamically; this affects, for example, average relatedness among group members. We assume two different scenarios: intact families in which the breeder is 100% monogamous and stepfamilies in which the breeder shifts mate between breeding events. The average relatedness among family members is allowed to evolve in concert with changes in provisioning effort. Our model shows that an individual's provisioning effort is not easy to predict from either its relatedness to the offspring or its reproductive value. Instead, it is necessary to consider the inclusive fitness effect of provisioning, which is determined by a combination of relatedness, reproductive value, and the reproductive value of the offspring.},

Mite load was usually a better predictor of coloration than pectoral muscle score, but the opposite was true for changes in wing length. In contrast to house finches, birds whose plumage was dull before moult had higher mite loads while moulting.

Oil droplets located in the long- wavelength-sensitive-single cones of both species cut off wavelengths below 570-573 nm, theoretically shifting cone peak spectral sensitivity some 40 nm towards the long-wavelength end of the spectrum. This raises the possibility that the precise lambda(max) of the long-wavelength-sensitive visual pigment is optimised for the visual function of the double cones.

Land birds tended to show either posterior dorsal to anterior ventral or anterior dorsal to posterior ventral gradients in cone photoreceptor distribution, fundus coloration and oil droplet pigmentation across the retina. Marine birds tended to show dorsal to ventral gradients instead. Statistical analyses showed that the proportions of the different cone types varied significantly across the retinae of all species investigated.

Using the absolute percentages of each oil droplet type in each quadrant for the analysis produced clusters that tended to reflect phylogenetic relatedness between species rather than similarities in their visual ecology. Repeating the analysis after subtracting the mean percentage of a given oil droplet type across the whole retina (the 'eye mean') from the percentage of that oil droplet type in each quadrant, i.e. to give a measure of the variation about the mean, resulted in clusters that reflected diet, feeding behaviour and habitat to a greater extent than phylogeny.},

   Abstract = {The ecological constraints hypothesis is widely accepted as an explanation for the evolution of delayed dispersal in cooperatively breeding birds. Intraspecific studies offer the strongest support. Observational studies have demonstrated a positive association between the severity of ecological constraints and the prevalence of cooperation, and experimental studies in which constraints on independent breeding were relaxed resulted in helpers moving to adopt the vacant breeding opportunities. However, this hypothesis has proved less successful in explaining why cooperative breeding has evolved in some species or lineages but not in others; Comparative studies have failed to identify ecological factors that differ consistently between cooperative and noncooperative species. The life history hypothesis, which emphasizes the role of life history traits in the evolution of cooperative breeding, coffers a solution to this difficulty. A recent analysis showed that low adult mortality and low dispersal predisposed certain lineages to show cooperative behaviour, given the right ecological conditions. This represents an important advance, not least by offering an explanation for the patchy phylogenetic distribution of cooperative breeding. We discuss the complementary nature of these two hypotheses and suggest that rather than regarding life history traits as predisposing and ecological factors as facilitating cooperation, they are more likely to act in concert. While acknowledging that different cooperative systems may be a consequence of different selective pressures, we suggest that to identify the key differences between-cooperative and noncooperative species, a broad constraints hypothesis that incorporates ecological and life history traits in a single measure of 'turnover of breeding opportunities' may provide the most promising avenue for future comparative studies.

   Abstract = {Biotic element analysis is an alternative to the areas-of- endemism approach for recognizing the presence or absence of vicariance events in a given region. If an ancestral biota was fragmented by vicariance events, biotic elements or clusters of distribution areas should emerge. We propose a statistical test for clustering of distribution areas based on a Monte Carlo simulation with a null model that considers the spatial autocorrelation in the data. The hypothesis tested is that the observed degree of clustering of ranges can be explained by the range size distribution, the varying number of taxa per cell, and the spatial autocorrelation of the occurrences of a taxon alone. A method for the delimitation of biotic elements which uses model-based Gaussian clustering is introduced. We demonstrate our methods and show the importance of grid size by means of a case study, an analysis of the distribution patterns of southern African species of the weevil genus Scobius. The example highlights the difficulties in delimiting areas of endemism if dispersal has occurred and illustrates the advantages of the biotic element approach.},

   Abstract = {In mating competition, the truthful signalling hypothesis (TSH), sometimes known as the handicap principle, asserts that higher-quality males signal while lower-quality males do not (or else emit smaller signals). Also, the signals are "believed", that is, females mate preferentially with higher- signalling males. Our analysis employs specific functional forms to generate analytic solutions and numerical simulations that illuminate the conditions needed to validate the TSH. Analytic innovations include: (1) A Mating Success Function indicates how female mating choices respond to higher and lower signalling levels. (2) A congestion function rules out corner solutions in which females would mate exclusively with higher- quality males. (3) A Malthusian condition determines equilibrium population size as related to per-capita resource availability. Equilibria validating the TSH are achieved over a wide range of parameters, though not universally. For TSH equilibria it is not strictly necessary that the high-quality males have an advantage in terms of lower per-unit signalling costs, but a cost difference in favor of the low-quality males cannot be too great if a TSH equilibrium is to persist. And although the literature has paid less attention to these points, TSH equilibria may also fail if. the quality disparity among males is too great, or the proportion of high-quality males in the population is too large, or if the congestion effect is too weak. Signalling being unprofitable in aggregate, it can take off from a no-signalling equilibrium only if the trait used for signalling is not initially a handicap, but instead is functionally useful at low levels. Selection for this trait sets in motion a bandwagon, whereby the initially useful indicator is pushed by male-male competition into the domain where it does indeed become a handicap.

   Abstract = {Recent behavioural experiments have shown that birds use ultraviolet (UV)-reflective and fluorescent plumage as cues in mate choice. It remains controversial, however, whether such UV signals play a special role in sexual communication, or whether they are part of general plumage coloration. We use a comparative approach to test for a general association between sexual signalling and either UV-reflective or fluorescent plumage. Among the species surveyed, 72% have UV colours and there is a significant positive association between UV reflectance and courtship displays. Among parrots (Psittaciformes), 68% of surveyed species have fluorescent plumage, and again there is a strong positive association between courtship displays and fluorescence. These associations are not artefacts of the plumage used in courtship displays, being generally more 'colourful' because there is no association between display and colours lacking UV reflectance or fluorescence. Equally, these associations are not phylogenetic artefacts because all results remain unchanged when families or genera, rather than species, are used as independent data points. We also find that, in parrots, fluorescent plumage is usually found adjacent to UV-reflective plumage. Using a simple visual model to examine one parrot, the budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus, we show that the juxtaposition of UV-reflective and fluorescent plumage leads to a 25-fold increase in chromatic contrast to the budgerigar's visual system. Taken together, these results suggest that signals based on UV contrast are of special importance in the context of active sexual displays. We review briefly six hypotheses on why this may be the case: suitability for short- range signalling; high contrast with backgrounds; invisibility to predators; exploitation of pre-existing sensory biases; advertisement of feather structure; and amplification of behavioural signals.},

A considerable amount of ambiguity and inconsistency persists within the field, and we provide a number of suggestions that should improve study design, inference, and clarity of presentation. (1) Some studies measure change over time within a population (allochronic) and others measure the difference between two populations that had a common ancestor in the past (synchronic). Allochronic studies can be used to estimate rates of "evolution," whereas synchronic studies more appropriately estimate rates of "divergence." Rates of divergence may range from a small fraction to many times the actual evolutionary rates in the component populations. (2) Some studies measure change using individuals captured from the wild, whereas others measure differences after rearing in a common environment. The first type of study can be used to specify "phenotypic" rates and the later "genetic" rates. (3) The most commonly used evolutionary rate metric, the darwin, has a number of theoretical shortcomings. Studies of microevolution would benefit from specifying rates in standard deviations per generation, the haldane. (4) Evolutionary rates are typically specified without an indication of their precision. Readily available methods for specifying confidence intervals and statistical significance (regression, bootstrapping, randomization) should be implemented. (5) Microevolutionists should strive to accumulate time series, which can reveal temporal shifts in the rate of evolution and can be used to identify evolutionary patterns. (6) Evolutionary rates provide a convenient way to compare the tempo of evolution across studies, traits, taxa, and time scales, but such comparisons are subject to varying degrees of confidence. Comparisons across different time scales are particularly tenuous. (7) A number of multivariate rate measures exist, but considerable theoretical development is required before their utility can be determined. We encourage the continued investigation of evolutionary rates because the information they provide is relevant to a wide range of theoretical and practical issues.},

   Abstract = {The advent of multiple regression analyses of natural selection has facilitated estimates of both the direct and indirect effects of selection on many traits in numerous organisms. However, low power in selection studies has possibly led to a bias in our assessment of the levels of selection shaping natural populations. Using calculations and simulations based on the statistical properties of selection coefficients, we find that power to detect total selection (the selection differential) depends on sample size and the strength of selection relative to the opportunity of selection. The power of detecting direct selection (selection gradients) is more complicated and depends on the relationship between the correlation of each trait and fitness and the pattern of correlation among traits. In a review of 298 previously published selection differentials, we find that most studies have had insufficient power to detect reported levels of selection acting on traits and that, in general, the power of detecting weak levels of selection is low given current study designs. We also find that potential publication bias could explain the trend that reported levels of direct selection tend to decrease as study sizes increase, suggesting that current views of the strength of selection may be inaccurate and biased upward. We suggest that studies should be designed so that selection is analyzed on at least several hundred individuals, the total opportunity of selection be considered along with the pattern of selection on individual traits, and nonsignificant results be actively reported combined with an estimate of power.},

   Pages = {2287-2298},
   Abstract = {Starting with the Price equation, I show that the total evolutionary change in mean phenotype that occurs in the presence of fitness variation can be partitioned exactly into five components representing logically distinct processes. One component is the linear response to selection, as represented by the breeder's equation of quantitative genetics. but with heritability defined as the linear regression coefficient of mean offspring phenotype on parent phenotype. The other components are identified as constitutive transmission bias, two types of induced transmission bias. and a spurious response to selection caused by a covariance between parental fitness and offspring phenotype that cannot be predicted from parental phenotypes. The partitioning can be accomplished in two ways, one with heritability measured before (in the absence of) selection, and the other with heritability measured after (in the presence of) selection. Measuring heritability after selection, though unconventional, yields a representation for the linear response to selection that is most consistent with Darwinian evolution by natural selection because the response to selection is determined by the reproductive features of the selected group, not of the parent population as a whole. The analysis of an explicitly Mendelian model shows that the relative contributions of the five terms to the total evolutionary change depends on the level of organization (gene, individual, or mated pair) at which the parent population is divided into phenotypes, with each frame of reference providing unique insight. It is shown that all five components of phenotypic evolution will generally have nonzero values as a result of various combinations of the normal features of Mendelian populations, including biparental sex, allelic dominance, inbreeding, epistasis, linkage disequilibrium, and environmental covariances between traits. Additive genetic variance can be a poor predictor of the adaptive response to selection in these models. The narrow-sense heritability sigma(A)(2)/sigma(P)(2) should be viewed as an approximation to the offspring-parent linear regression rather than the other way around.},

   Abstract = {Using a set of nine effectively isogenic lines collected from nature in 1998, we observed unperturbed behaviors of mixed-sex groups of Drosophila melanogaster. We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding, grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for-our quantitative genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41% of the variation in activity; 8.60% of the variation was explained by a significant genotype X sex interaction, which signifies genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity explained 11.13% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups within genotype accounted for 19.47% variation in activity, and activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01%), and this is an additional level on which selection could operate: individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution. Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to understand how behaviors evolve.},

However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of 'set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders.},

Regardless of their age or coloration in the wild, captive males converged on a similar appearance after completing prebasic molt on a standardized diet, with significantly less variance in coloration than is found among wild males. Captive males that were fed a diet deficient in carotenoid pigments grew pale yellow feathers; males fed a diet supplemented with beta-carotene grew pale orange feathers; and males fed a diet supplemented with canthaxanthin grew bright red feathers. Stored carotenoids did not appear to be an important source of feather pigments. Red males captured from the wild just prior to fall molt and fed a carotenoid-deficient diet did not grow more colorful feathers than males that had been held in captivity on a carotenoid-deficient diet for six to nine months prior to fall molt. In a wild House Finch population in southeastern Michigan, the mean plumage coloration of yearling males was significantly drabber than the mean coloration of older males, although both groups displayed approximately the same range of coloration. Wild males tended to become brighter between their first and second springs, but thereafter, males tended to display a similar plumage coloration between years. The extent of ventral carotenoid pigmentation (color-patch size) also was partly dependent on carotenoid intake. Captive males whose diet was supplemented with canthaxanthin produced significantly larger patches after captive molt than before captive molt, and canthaxanthin- supplemented males also expressed significantly larger patches than males in the carotenoid-deficient or beta-carotene- supplemented groups. Among wild males, there was a significant positive correlation between patch size and plumage brightness.},

Regardless of the appearance of males in their own populations, however, females from all populations showed a preference for the most brightly colored males and males with the largest patches. A reduction in patch size independent of a change in female mate preference is not consistent with sensory-bias or reproductive isolation models of sexual selection or with general predictions of runaway models of sexual selection.

It has generally been assumed that carotenoid-based colour displays act as signals of quality because they reflect the foraging ability of the bearer, but this hypothesis has not been tested. In birds, carotenoid pigmentation of feathers is deposited at the time of moult. During moult, feathers grow in regular daily cycles resulting in 'growth bars' that provide a record of the rate of feather growth. To test the idea that the brightness of carotenoid coloration reflects nutritional condition during moult, we compared the brightness of carotenoid-based plumage coloration with both feather growth rate and timing of moult in male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). Among four populations with substantial differences in mean male plumage brightness, there was no significant variation in mean feather growth rate. Thus, the reduced brightness of some populations is not the result of reduced access to food per se. Within populations, we found a significant positive relation between the growth rate of a male's tail feathers and the brightness of his plumage, suggesting that males growing brighter feathers are in better nutritional condition. The growth rate of tail feathers of captive males provided with ad libitum food was also significantly greater than the growth rate of males in any wild populations. Within populations, we also found a significant negative relation between the onset of moult and plumage colour, with males growing brighter feathers starting moulting earlier. These observations provide support for the hypothesis that carotenoid-based plumage coloration is an indicator of nutritional condition during moult. Variation in nutritional condition may arise from differences among individuals in either their foraging ability or their health.},

   Abstract = {Understanding the relative costs of different forms of ornamental displays is fundamental to research on the evolution of such traits. For traits such as elongated tails, assessing the degree of exaggeration is straight-forward: bigger is more exaggerated and more costly. In contrast, assignment of such a hierarchical ranking of costliness and exaggeration to color displays has not been possible. In this paper, I consider whether red carotenoid displays represent a more energetically costly form of ornamentation than yellow or orange carotenoid displays. Several lines of evidence support the idea that red carotenoid pigmentation is particularly costly. Red carotenoid pigments are less abundant than yellow pigments in the diet of virtually all vertebrates. Although many vertebrates can convert some yellow carotenes and xanthophylls to red pigments, all species appear to be restricted in the types of metabolic conversions of which they are capable as well as by the costs of such conversions. In virtually all avian taxa with carotenoid-based coloration, when females and juvenile males show plumage hue that is different than that of adult males, their plumage is less red (more orange or yellow). Finally, in a comparative study of cardueline finches, there was a significant positive relationship between the degree of sexual dichromatism and the redness of male plumage, suggesting that red is a particularly costly color display. The finding that red is a more costly color display than yellow or orange has important implications for comparative studies of the evolution of ornamental plumage.},

Expression of carotenoid-based coloration is known to be dependent on condition, while the effects of individual condition have not been well-tested for expression of melanin- based coloration. In this study we experimentally tested the effect of coccidial infection of the intestinal tract of male house finches during moult on expression of melanin-based plumage coloration. Coccidial infection had a significant negative effect on carotenoid-based coloration, but it had no significant effect on melanin-based feather coloration. Unlike carotenoid-based coloration, melanin-based coloration my be cheap to produce, and honesty of melanin-based coloration may require social mediation.},

Unlike other integumentary pigments, carotenoids cannot be synthesized; they must be ingested. Carotenoid-based coloration is condition-dependent and has been shown to be affected by both parasites and nutritional condition. A controversial hypothesis is that the expression of carotenoid-based coloration in wild vertebrates is also affected by the amount and types of carotenoid pigments that are ingested. We tested this carotenoid-limitation hypothesis by sampling the gut contents of moulting house finches and comparing the concentration of carotenoid pigments in their gut contents with the colour of growing feathers. We found a positive association: males that ingested food with a higher concentration of carotenoid pigments grew brighter ornamental plumage. We also compared the concentration of carotenoids in the gut contents of males from two subspecies of house finches with small and large patches of carotenoid-based coloration. Consistent with the hypothesis that carotenoid access drives the evolution of carotenoid-based colour displays, males from the population with limited ornamentation had much lower concentrations of carotenoids in their gut contents than males from the population with extensive ornamentation. These observations support the idea that carotenoid intake plays a part in determining the plumage brightness of male house finches.},

All birds were maintained through molt on a diet of seeds with tangerine juice added to their water as a source of beta-cryptoxanthin, the natural precursor to the primary red carotenoid pigment in house finch plumage. All males grew drab plumage, but males with NIG infection grew leathers that were significantly less red (more yellow), less saturated, and less bright than males that were not infected. MG targets upper respiratory and ocular tissue.

Although the posterior distributions for these models are rarely available in closed form, the usual conjugate structure of the prior specification allows for painless calculation of the Gibbs conditionals. Thus the Gibbs sampler may be used to explore the posterior distribution without ever having established propriety of the posterior. An example is given showing that the output from a Gibbs chain corresponding to an improper posterior may appear perfectly reasonable. Thus one cannot expect the Gibbs output to provide a ''red flag:'' informing the user that the posterior is improper. The user must demonstrate propriety before a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is used. A theorem is given that classifies improper priors according to the propriety of the resulting posteriors. Applications concerning Bayesian analysis of animal breeding data and the location of maxima of unwieldy (restricted) likelihood functions are discussed. Gibbs sampling with improper posteriors is then considered in more generality. The concept of functional compatibility of conditional densities is introduced and is used to construct an invariant measure for a class of Markov chains. These results are used to show that Gibbs chains corresponding to improper posteriors are, in theory, quite ill-behaved.},

   Abstract = {Recent advances in computing make it practical to use complex hierarchical models. However, the complexity makes it difficult to see how features of the data determine the fitted model. This paper describes an approach to diagnostics for hierarchical models, specifically linear hierarchical models with additive normal or t-errors. The key is to express hierarchical models in the form of ordinary linear models by adding artificial 'cases' to the data set corresponding to the higher levels of the hierarchy. The error term of this linear model is not homoscedastic, but its covariance structure is much simpler than that usually used in variance component or random effects models. The re-expression has several advantages. First, it is extremely general, covering dynamic linear models, random effect and mixed effect models, and pairwise difference models, among others. Second, it makes more explicit the geometry of hierarchical models, by analogy with the geometry of linear models. Third, the analogy with linear models provides a rich source of ideas for diagnostics for all the parts of hierarchical models. This paper gives diagnostics to examine candidate added variables, transformations, collinearity, case influence and residuals.},

   Abstract = {Microsatellite genotyping errors will be present in all but the smallest data sets and have the potential to undermine the conclusions of most downstream analyses. Despite this, little rigorous effort has been made to quantify the size of the problem and to identify the commonest sources of error. Here, we use a large data set comprising almost 2000 Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella genotyped at nine hypervariable microsatellite loci to explore error detection methods, common sources of error and the consequences of errors on paternal exclusion. We found good concordance among a range of contrasting approaches to error-rate estimation, our range being 0.0013 to 0.0074 per single locus PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The best approach probably involves blind repeat-genotyping, but this is also the most labour-intensive. We show that several other approaches are also effective at detecting errors, although the most convenient alternative, namely mother-offspring comparisons, yielded the lowest estimate of the error rate. In total, we found 75 errors, emphasizing their ubiquitous presence. The most common errors involved the misinterpretation of allele banding patterns (n = 60,80%) and of these, over a third (n = 22,36.7%) were due to confusion between homozygote and adjacent allele heterozygote genotypes. A specific test for whether a data set contains the expected number of adjacent allele heterozygotes could provide a useful tool with which workers can assess the likely size of the problem. Error rates are also positively correlated with both locus polymorphism and product size, again indicating aspects where extra effort at error reduction should be directed. Finally, we conducted simulations to explore the potential impact of genotyping errors on paternity exclusion. Error rates as low as 0.01 per allele resulted in a rate of false paternity exclusion exceeding 20%. Errors also led to reduced estimates of male reproductive skew and increases in the numbers of pups that matched more than one candidate male. Because even modest error rates can be strongly influential, we recommend that error rates should be routinely published and that researchers make an attempt to calculate how robust their analyses are to errors.},

In contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within-population inbreeding. In particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in Hardy Weinberg proportions. Our estimate of F-ST incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within-population inbreeding. Simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of F-ST. Moreover, some information about the degree of within-population inbreeding (F-IS) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations.

The color of carotenoid spots and ability to attract females were compared between experimentally infected fish and a control group of their full-sib brothers, which had identical color patterns and were treated identically except for actual exposure to parasites. The orange spots of males that had been infected for 9 days followed by treatment with medication to remove parasites became significantly paler and less saturated. Control males (also treated with medication) showed no significant changes in their orange spots. Females in a divided aquarium choice-apparatus showed no preference between control and infection-treatment males initially, but showed significant discrimination after the infection-disinfection treatment. Females spent less time near males that had been infected and responded to a smaller fraction of their courtship displays relative to control males. There were slight differences in courting rates of males between treatments. Parasitic infection appears to reduce the degree of expression of carotenoid colors in guppies, and females are able to discriminate against recently infected males, probably on the basis of the color change. By avoiding infected males, females may be able to avoid becoming infected themselves, or they may be able to identify mates based on "good genes" for parasite resistance that can be passed on to their offspring.},

I assume that genetic variance is maintained by mutation-selection balance. The relative numbers of loci that play a role in acquiring versus allocating a limiting resource play a crucial role in determining genetic covariance. If many loci are involved in acquiring a resource, genetic covariance may be either negative or positive at equilibrium, depending on the fitness function and the input of mutational variance. The form of G does not necessarily reveal the constraint on resource acquisition inherent in the system, and therefore studies estimating G do not test for the existence of life- history tradeoffs. Characters may evolve in patterns that are unpredictable from G. Experiments are suggested that would indicate if this model could explain observations of positive genetic covariance.},

   Abstract = {There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

Costly female preferences for males with exaggerated traits that reduce viability, such as die peacock's tail, are particularly puzzling. Such preferences can evolve if directly favoured by natural selection or when the exaggerated trait, although maladaptive per se, indicates high overall quality of the male's genotype. Two recent analyses suggested that the advantage to mate choice based on genetic quality is too weak to explain extreme cases of exaggeration of display traits and the corresponding preferences. We studied coevolution of a female mate-preference function and a genotype-dependent male display function where mutation supplies variation in genotype quality and mate preference is costly. Preference readily evolves, often causing extreme exaggeration of the display. Mate choice and trait expression can approach an equilibrium, or a limit cycle, or exaggeration can proceed forever, eventually causing extinction.},

CPC was developed as a method of data surnmarization, but frequently biologists would like to use the method to detect analogous patterns of trait correlation in multiple populations or species. To investigate the properties of CPC, we simulated data that reflect a set of causal factors. The CPC method performs as expected from a statistical point of view, but often gives results that are contrary to biological intuition. In general, CPC tends to underestimate the degree of structure that matrices share. Differences of trait variances and covariances due to a difference in a single causal factor in two otherwise identically structured datasets often cause CPC to declare the two datasets unrelated. Conversely, CPC could identify datasets as having the same structure when causal factors are different. Reordering of vectors before analysis can aid in the detection of patterns. We urge caution in the biological interpretation of CPC analysis results.},

Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling of evolutionary time from amount of character change.

   Abstract = {Alternative models of the maintenance of genetic variability, theories of life-history evolution, and theories of sexual selection and mate choice can be tested by measuring additive and nonadditive genetic variances of components of fitness. A quantitative genetic breeding design was used to produce estimates of genetic variances for male life-history traits in Drosophila melanogaster. Additive genetic covariances and correlations between traits were also estimated. Flies from a large, outbred, laboratory population were assayed for age- specific competitive mating ability, age-specific survivorship, body mass, and fertility. Variance-component analysis then allowed the decomposition of phenotypic variation into components associated with additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and environmental variability. A comparison of dominance and additive components of genetic variation provides little support for an important role for balancing selection in maintaining genetic variance in this suite of traits. The results provide support for the mutation-accumulation theory, but not the antagonistic-pleiotropy theory of senescence. No evidence is found for the positive genetic correlations between mating success and offspring quality or quantity chat are predicted by ''good genes'' models of sexual selection. Additive genetic coefficients of variation for life-history characters are larger than those for body weight. Finally, this set of male life-history characters exhibits a very low correspondence between estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations.},

These revelations have caused reassessment of established hypotheses and broadened the array of tractable questions. In this review I first discuss studies of vertebrate mating systems in which these techniques have been used to reveal the "genetic mating system," often yielding results that have shaken long-held hypotheses about monogamy and polygyny. Second, I discuss studies of social groups in which the techniques have allowed assessment of kinship and thereby permitted more comprehensive application of kin selection theory; these studies have illuminated phenomena as diverse as ant colony sex ratios and cooperative breeding in birds. The use of DNA sequence data to provide robust phylogenies that support rigorous comparative analyses is just beginning.

We illustrate the use of this nea equation with data collected, using automated weighing platforms, on six pars of chick growth of Black-browed Diomedea melanophris and Grey-headed D. chryostoma albatrosses at Bird Island, South Georgia. In comparison with Grey-headed Albatross, Black-browed Albatross chicks grow at a faster rate and to a higher peak mass; they also reach their peak mass at an earlier age, and lose mass at a faster rate in the mass recession period However, in both species, chicks reached peak mass when 72% of the rearing period had elapsed; within species, only this did not vary between years. This new equation not only enables the period df mass recession to be incorporated into growth analysis, but, because it does not require assumptions about asymptotic mass, greatly facilitates inter-species comparisons.},

Reflectance spectrophotometry reveals that blue tit plumage shows considerable reflection of UV light. For example, the blue crest shows peak reflectance at wavelengths around 352 nm. Furthermore, the blue tit is sexually dichromatic for multiple regions of plumage, including the crest. Choice trials performed in the laboratory indicate that females prefer males with the brightest crests.

   Abstract = {Parents often have important influences on the development of traits in their offspring. One mechanism by which parents are able to influence offspring phenotype is through the level of care they provide. In onthophagine dung beetles, parents typically provision their offspring by packing dung fragments into a brood mass. Onthophagus taurus males can be separated into two discrete morphs: Large, "major" males have head horns, whereas "minor" males are hornless. Here we show that a switch in parental provisioning strategies adopted by males coincides with the switch in male morphology. Male provisioning results in the production of heavier brood masses than females will produce alone. However, unlike females in which the level of provisioning increases with body size in a continuous manner, the level of provisioning provided by males represents an "all- or-none" tactic with all major males providing a Bred level of provisioning irrespective of their body size. Offspring size is determined largely by the quantity of dung provided to the developing larvae so that paternal and maternal provisioning affects the body size and horn size of offspring produced. The levels of provisioning by individual parents are significantly repeatable, suggesting paternal and maternal effects as candidate indirect genetic effects in the evolution of horn size in the genus Onthophagus.},

The effect was very strong despite little or no UV reflection from several plumage areas. However, it is not clear how the importance of the UV waveband compares to other regions of the bird-visible spectrum. We tested whether the response of female zebra finches to the removal of male UV reflection is greater than to the removal of other wavebands. We presented females with a choice of males whose appearance was manipulated using coloured filters. The filters removed single blocks of the avian visible spectrum corresponding closely to the spectral sensitivities of each of the zebra finch's single cone classes. This resulted in males that effectively had no UV (UV-), no short-wave (SW-), no medium-wave (MW-) or no long-wave (LW-) plumage reflection. Females preferred UV- and SW- males. LW- and MW- males were least preferred, suggesting that female zebra finches show the greatest response to the removal of longer wavelengths. Quantal catches of the single cone types viewing body areas of the male zebra finch are presented for each treatment. Our study suggests it is important to consider the role of the UV waveband in avian mate choice in conjunction with the rest of the avian visible spectrum.},

   Abstract = {While theoretical models of the evolution of parental care are based on the assumption of underlying genetic variance, surprisingly few quantitative genetic studies of this life- history trait exist. Estimation of the degree of genetic variance in parental care is important because it can be a significant source of maternal effects, which, if genetically based, represent indirect genetic effects. A major prediction of indirect genetic effect theory is that traits without heritable variation can evolve because of the heritable environmental variation that indirect genetic effects provide. In the dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus, females provide care to offspring by provisioning a brood mass. The size of the brood mass has pronounced effects on offspring phenotype. Using a half-sib breeding design we show that the weight of the brood mass females produce exhibits significant levels of additive genetic variance due to sires. However, variance caused by dams is considerably larger, demonstrating that maternal effects are also important. Body size exhibited low additive genetic variance. However, body size exerts a strong maternal influence on the weight of brood masses produced, accounting for 22% of the nongenetic variance in offspring body size. Maternal body size also influenced the number of offspring produced but there was no genetic variance for this trait. Offspring body size and brood mass weight exhibited positive genetic and phenotypic correlations. We conclude that both indirect genetic effects, via maternal care, and nongenetic maternal effects, via female size, play important roles in the evolution of phenotype in this species.},

Nevertheless, males of many avian species and a minority of mammalian species provide parental care, and females of various species mate with multiple males. I investigate a two-locus genetic model for evolution of male parental care and female multiple mating in which females gain a direct benefit by multiple mating from the paternal care they thereby elicit for their offspring. The model suggests that, first, male parental care can evolve when it strongly enhances offspring survival and the direct costs of female multiple mating (e. g., loss of energy, risk of injury, exposure to infectious diseases) are greater than its indirect benefit (e. g., acquisition of good genes, increased genetic diversity among offspring); second, female multiple mating can evolve when paternal care is important for offspring survival or the indirect benefit of multiple mating is larger than its direct cost; and, finally, male parental care and female multiple mating can co-occur.},

   Abstract = {Like males of many bird species, male House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) have patches of feathers with ornamental coloration that are due to carotenoid pigments. Within populations, male House Finches vary in expression of ornamental coloration from pale yellow to bright red, which previous research suggested was the result of variation in types and amounts of carotenoid pigments deposited in feathers. Here we used improved analytical techniques to describe types and amounts of carotenoid pigments present in that plumage. We then used those data to make comparisons of carotenoid composition of feathers of male House Finches at three levels: among individual males with different plumage hue and saturation, between age groups of males from the same population, and between males from two subspecies that differ in extent of ventral carotenoid pigmentation (patch size): large-patched C. in. frontalis from coastal California and small-patched C. in. griscomi from Guerrero, Mexico. In all age groups and populations, the ornamental plumage coloration of male House Finches resulted from the same 13 carotenoid pigments, with 3-hydroxy echinenone and lutein being the most abundant carotenoid pigments. The composition of carotenoids in feathers suggested that House Finches are capable of metabolic transformation of dietary forms of carotenoids. The hue of male plumage depended on component carotenoids, their relative concentrations, and total concentration of all carotenoids. Most 4-keto (red) carotenoids were positively correlated with plumage redness, and most yellow carotenoid pigments were negatively associated with plumage redness, although the strength of the relationship for specific carotenoid pigments varied among age groups and subspecies. Using age and subspecies as factors and concentration of each component carotenoid as dependent variables in a MANOVA, we found a distinctive pigment profile for each age group within each subspecies. Among frontalis males, hatch-year birds did not differ from adults in mean plumage hue, but they had a significantly lower proportion of red pigments in their plumage, and significantly lower levels of the red piments adonirubin and astaxanthin, but significantly higher levels of the yellow pigment zeaxanthin, than adult males. Among griscomi males, hatch-year birds differed from adults in plumage hue but not significantly in pigment composition, though in general their feathers had lower concentrations of red pigments and higher concentrations of yellow pigments than adult males. Both adult and hatch-year frontalis males differed from griscomi males in having significantly higher levels of most yellow carotenoid pigments and significantly lower levels of most red carotenoid pigments. Variation in pigment profiles of subspecies and age classes may reflect differences among the groups in carotenoid metabolism, in dietary access to carotenoids, or in exposure to environmental factors, such as parasites, that may affect pigmentation.},

   Abstract = {The evolutionary divergence of a single species into two has never been directly observed in nature, primarily because speciation can take a long time to occur. A ring species, in which a chain of intergrading populations encircles a barrier and the terminal forms coexist without interbreeding, provides a situation in which variation in space can be used to infer variation in time(1-3). Here we reconstruct the pathway to speciation between two reproductively isolated forms of greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides). These two taxa do not interbreed in central Siberia but are connected by a long chain of intergrading populations encircling the Tibetan Plateau to the south(4). Molecular data and climatic history imply that the reproductively isolated taxa came into contact following expansions northward around the western and eastern sides of the plateau. Parallel selection pressures for increased song complexity during the northward expansions have been accompanied by divergence in song structure. Playback experiments show that the two Siberian forms do not recognize each other's songs. Our results show how gradual divergence in a trait involved in mate choice leads to the formation of new species.},

   Abstract = {Here we give an introduction to the growing number of statistical techniques for analyzing data that are not independent realizations of the same sampling process-in other words, correlated data. We focus on regression problems, in which the value of a given variable depends linearly on the value of another variable. To illustrate different types of processes leading to correlated data, we analyze four simulated examples representing diverse problems arising in ecological studies. The first example is a comparison among species to determine the relationship between home-range area and body size; because species are phylogenetically related, they do not represent independent samples. The second example addresses spatial variation in net primary production and how this might be affected by soil nitrogen; because nearby locations are likely to have similar net primary productivity for reasons other than soil nitrogen, spatial correlation is likely. In the third example, we consider a time-series model to ask whether the decrease in density of a butterfly species is the result of decreases in its host-plant density; because the population density of a species in one generation is likely to affect the density in the following generation, time-series data are often correlated. The fourth example combines both spatial and temporal correlation in an experiment in which prey densities are manipulated to determine the response of predators to their food supply. For each of these examples, we use a different statistical approach for analyzing models of correlated data. Our goal is to give an overview of conceptual issues surrounding correlated data, rather than a detailed tutorial in how to apply different statistical techniques. By dispelling some of the mystery behind correlated data, we hope to encourage ecologists to learn about statistics that could be useful in their own work. Although at first encounter these techniques might seem complicated, they have the power to simplify ecological research by making more types of data and experimental designs open to statistical evaluation.},

   Abstract = {Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume that variation within species is absent or at least negligible, which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation has several components. Differences among populations of the same species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct effects of environmental factors that differ among populations (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include within-species variation, or "measurement error" as it is often termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i) univariate analyses, including measurement of "phylogenetic signal," (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of "functional relations," such as reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species or population), but they can be modified for special cases in which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain) parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to account for measurement error, such as conventional RMA regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab programs.

   Abstract = {Males of many species use multiple sexual ornaments in their courtship display. We investigate the evolution of female sexual preferences for more than a single male trait by the handicap process. The handicap process assumes that ornaments are indicators of male quality, and a female benefits from mate choice by her offspring inheriting ''good genes'' that increase survival chances. A new handicap model is developed that allows equilibria to be given in terms of selection pressures, independent of genetic parameters. Multiple sexual preferences evolve if the overall cost of choice is not greatly increased by a female using additional male traits in her assessment of potential mates. However, only a single preference is evolutionarily stable if assessment of additional male traits greatly increases the overall cost of choice (more than expected by combining the cost of each preference independently). Any single preference can evolve, the outcome being determined by initial conditions. The evolution of one preference effectively blocks the evolution of others, even for traits that are better indicators of male quality. Comparison is made with sexual selection caused by Fisher's runaway process in which male traits are purely attractive characters. This shows that sexual preferences for multiple Fisher traits are likely to evolve alongside preference for a single handicap trait that indicates male quality. This is a general difference in the evolutionary outcome of these two causes of sexual selection.},

We extend our analysis to species in which males provide direct benefits (e.g. parental care, better resources, the absence of contagious diseases). Male quality now affects female fitness by increasing female reproductive success. For this good parent handicap to work, the male signal must have condition-dependent expression. The equilibrium strength of female preference is controlled by the product of signal transmission efficiency, phenotypic variance of male quality and the effectiveness of male quality in improving female reproductive success. The equilibrium resulting from the good parent handicap has exactly the same form as with the good genes handicap. This allows us to compare the relative importance of these two forces in the evolution of female preferences. The handicap models (both good genes and good parent) also show cyclic evolution, as happens with the pure Fisherian model. However, we predict that the handicap process is often strong enough to lead to a stable equilibrium. This leads to the conclusion that cyclic evolution is-less likely to occur for handicap than Fisherian traits. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

I have performed a comprehensive census of body-size changes in a large fauna of Cretaceous bivalve and gastropod genera. A directional net increase in body size (including the loss of small-sized species and thus representing Cope's rule in the strict sense) is no more frequent than an increase in size range among species or a net evolutionary size decrease. Thus the undisputed ecological importance of body size does not translate into a preferred macroevolutionary pattern.},

The traditional and bootstrapped Kaiser-Guttman approaches overestimated the number of nontrivial dimensions as did the fixed-amount-of-variance model. The scree plot consistently estimated one dimension more than the number of simulated dimensions. Bartlett's test of sphericity showed inconsistent results.

It provides a reasonable description of a wide range of different covariance structures, and it results in the best models for actual data. Our analysis suggests genetic variance for Drosophila mortality declines with age, while genetic variance is constant at all ages for reproductive output. For growth in beef cattle, however, genetic variance increases linearly from birth, and genetic correlations are high across all observed ages.},

   Abstract = {In this paper I argue that the general concordance among species of birds in their clinal (gradual) patterns of geographic variation in size and color of plumage is so high that the primary regulatory process must be physiological adaptation to climate or its correlates. Size variation in the American Robin, a widespread species that shows the pattern of clinal variation typical in North American passerines, can be well predicted by measures of summer climate that include the effects of both temperature and humidity. July mean noon absolute humidity is a good predictor of size variation in the robin within the United States. Geographic variation in the color of the plumage of the robin, which involves interactions among several pigments, is independent of its size variation but in accord with color variation in other species. Both Bergmann's and Gloger's ecogeographic rules are important empirical models for which the physiological basis needs further study. To establish that functional differences are subject to natural selection requires showing that geographic differences have a genetic basis and that these differences are related to the survival and reproduction of individuals at different localities. Laboratory and field experiments with Red-winged Blackbirds show that environmentally induced effects on development probably contribute to clines in measurements of adults in this species. Further work is needed to clarify the generality of the relationship between clinal variation and environmentally induced variation and to determine the functional significance of clines and their relationship to survival and reproduction in different localities. Environmental plasticity itself is geographically variable. It may have a genetic basis and be an object of selection.},

Models evolved from single-trait with one set of random regressions to multiple-trait applications with several random effects described by regressions. Gibbs sampling has been used for models with linear (with respect to coefficients) regressions and normality assumptions for random effects. Difficulties associated with implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo schemes include lack of good practical methods to assess convergence, slow mixing caused by high posterior correlations of parameters and long running time to generate enough posterior samples. Those problems are illustrated through comparison of Gibbs sampling schemes for single-trait random regression test-day models with different model parameterizations, different functions used for regressions and posterior chains of different sizes. Orthogonal polynomials showed better convergence and mixing properties in comparison with 'lactation curve' functions of the same number of parameters. Increasing the order of polynomials resulted in smaller number of independent samples for covariance components. Gibbs sampling under hierarchical model parameterization had a lower level of autocorrelation and required less time for computation. Posterior means and standard deviations of genetic parameters were very similar for chains of different size (from 20 000 to 1 000 000) after convergence. Single-trait random regression models with large data sets can be analysed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods in relatively short time.

We reconsider the motivation for this approach, paying special attention to the effects of nonnormal traits and fitness measures. We apply an alternative statistical method, logistic regression, to estimate the strength of selection on multiple phenotypic traits. First, we argue that the logistic regression model is more suitable than linear regression for analyzing data from selection studies with dichotomous fitness outcomes. Subsequently, we show that estimates of selection obtained from the logistic regression analyses can be transformed easily to values that directly plug into equations describing adaptive microevolutionary change. Finally, we apply this methodology to two published datasets to demonstrate its utility. Because most statistical packages now provide options to conduct logistic regression analyses, we suggest that this approach should be widely adopted as an analytical tool for empirical studies of multivariate selection.},

   Volume = {75},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {21-64},
   Abstract = {The aim of this review is to consider the potential benefits that females may gain from mating more than once in a single reproductive cycle. The relationship between non-genetic and genetic benefits is briefly explored. We suggest that multiple mating for purely non-genetic benefits is unlikely as it invariably leads to the possibility of genetic benefits as well. We begin by briefly reviewing the main models for genetic benefits to mate choice, and the supporting evidence that choice can increase offspring performance and the sexual attractiveness of sons. We then explain how multiple matin!: can elevate offspring fitness by increasing the number of potential sires that compete, when this occurs in conjunction with mechanisms of paternity biasing that function in copula or post-copulation. We begin by identifying cases where females use precopulatory cues to identify mates prior to remating. In the simplest case, females remate because they identify a superior mate and 'trade up' genetically. The main evidence for this process comes from extra-pair copulation in birds. Second, we note other cases where pre-copulatory cues may be less reliable and females mate with several males to promote post- copulatory mechanisms that bias paternity. Although a distinction is drawn between sperm competition and cryptic female choice, we point out that the genetic benefits to polyandry in terms of producing more viable or sexually attractive offspring do not depend on the exact mechanism that leads to biased paternity. Post-copulatory mechanisms of paternity biasing may: (1) reduce genetic incompatibility between male and female genetic contributions to offspring; (2) increase offspring viability if there is a positive correlation between traits favoured post-copulation and those that improve performance under natural selection; (3) increase the ability of sons to gain paternity when they mate with polyandrous females. A third possibility is that genetic diversity among offspring is directly favoured. This can be due to bet-hedging (due to mate assessment errors or temporal fluctuations in the environment), beneficial interactions between less related siblings of the opportunity to preferentially fertilise eggs with sperm of a specific genotype drawn from a range of stored sperm depending on prevailing environmental conditions. We use case studies from the social insects to provide some concrete examples of the role of genetic diversity among progeny in elevating fitness. We conclude that post-copulatory mechanisms provide a more reliable way of selecting a genetically compatible mate than pre-copulatory mate choice. Some of the best evidence for cryptic female choice by sperm selection is due to selection of more compatible sperm. Two future areas of research seem likely to be profitable. First, more experimental evidence is needed demonstrating that multiple mating increases offspring fitness via genetic gains. Second, the role of multiple mating in promoting assortative fertilization and increasing reproductive isolation between populations may help us to understand sympatric speciation.},

   Abstract = {Traits correlated with mak mating success are likely to be subject to sexual selection. Sexually selected characters are thought to be costly to develop and maintain. If males do not vary their investment in sexual traits in relation to their ability to bear the costs, there should be a negative relationship between male longevity or survival and the expression of sexual traits. In particular, a negative relationship is predicted by pureFisherian models for the evolution of sexual ornaments. The same should also be true for traits that evolve via pleiotropy (e.g., due to,sensory exploitation or bias) with no subsequent evolution of condition dependent modification. We collected information on the relationship between traits correlated with male mating rate and estimates of adult male survivorship or life span. In total we obtained 122 samples from 69 studies of 40 species of bird, spider, insect, and fish. In a mete-analysis we calculated the average sample size weighted correlation between trait expression and adult survival Analyses at the level of samples, studies, and species revealed significant positive relationships (r = 0. 08, 0. 10, and 0. 13, respectively; all P < 0.001). The unweighted correlation at the species level was r = 0.24. In general, males with larger ornaments or weapons, greater body size, or higher rates of courtship showed greater survivorship or longevity. This finding is inconsistent with pureFisherian model or other models that do not incorporate condition or quality dependent trait expression. It suggests that male investment in sexually selected traits is not fixed but varies in relation to the ability to pay the underlying costs of expressing these characters. Hence, many secondary sexual characters are likely to be condition dependent In their expression.},

First tests had significantly greater statistical power and reported more significant results (smaller p values) than did last tests. This trend was consistent across journals, taxa, and the type of statistical test used. On average, statistical power was 13-16% to detect a small effect and 40- 47% to detect a medium effect. This is far lower than the general recommendation of a power of 80%. By this criterion, only 2-3%, 13-21%, and 37-50% of the tests examined had the requisite power to detect a small, medium, or large effect, respectively. Neither p values nor statistical power varied significantly across the 10 journals or 11 taxa. However, mean p values of first and last tests were significantly correlated across journals (r =.67, n = 10, p =.034), with a similar trend for mean power (r =.63, n = 10, p =.051). There is therefore some evidence that power and p values are repeatable among journals. Mean p values or power of first and last tests were, however, uncorrelated across taxa. Finally, there was a significant correlation between power and reported p value for both first (r =.13, n = 684, p =.001) and last tests (r =.16, n = 654, p <.0001). If true effect sizes are unrelated to study sample sizes, the average true effect size must be nonzero for this pattern to emerge. This suggests that failure to observe significant relationships is partly owing to small sample sizes, as power increases with sample size. Key words: effect size, meta-analysis, publication bias, sample sizes, statistical power.},

In order to estimate the genetic parameters of the unselected population, all information that led to the current population must be included in the analysis. This is often not possible due to missing information or computer limitations, and, therefore, only samples of data and pedigree information of recent generations are included in analysis, and simplified operational models are used. Biases in genetic parameters, which were estimated by multitrait derivative-free REML method, were investigated in different strategies of sampling data and pedigree. In dual purpose cattle, in which young bulls are selected for growth before being progeny tested for milk yield, heritabilities and additive genetic correlations were all unbiased when all data and all relationships were used in an animal model. Using only recent data but all relationships in an animal model also gave unbiased estimates of heritabilities. Using an animal model for growth but a sire model for milk with all data gave an unbiased estimate of heritability for milk. When only recent data were used, the heritability estimate for milk was biased downward. In single purpose diary populations, sire models gave biased estimates of genetic parameters even when all data were included in the analysis. Treating sire effects on second crop of daughters as fixed did not overcome selection bias.},

We show that the level of heritability varies between 0.12 and 0.68 in six morphological traits in house sparrows (Passer domesticus L.) in northern Norway. Positive and negative genetic correlations were present among traits, suggesting evolutionary constraints on the evolution of some of these characters. A sexual difference in the amount of heritable genetic variation was found in tarsus length, wing length, bill depth and body condition index, with generally higher heritability in females. In addition, the structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix for the traits differed between the sexes. Genetic correlations between males and females for the morphological traits were however large and not significantly different from one, indicating that sex-specific responses to selection will be influenced by intersexual differences in selection differentials. Despite this, some traits had heritability above 0.1 in females, even after conditioning on the additive genetic covariance between sexes and the additive genetic variances in males. Moreover, a meta- analysis indicated that higher heritability in females than in males may be common in birds. Thus, this indicates sexual differences in the genetic architecture of birds. Consequently, as in house sparrows, the evolutionary responses to selection will often be larger in females than males. Hence, our results suggest that sex-specific additive genetic variances and covariances, although ignored in most studies, should be included when making predictions of evolutionary changes from standard quantitative genetic models.},

Nevertheless, it remains to be shown that a genetic benefit is passed on to offspring(5,6). Here we report that nestling bluethroats, Luscinia svecica, sired by extra-pair males had a higher T-cell-mediated immune response than their maternal half-siblings raised in the same nest. The difference could not be attributed to nestling body mass, sex or hatching order, but may be an effect of paternal genotype. Extra-pair young were also more immunocompetent than their paternal half-sibs raised in the genetic father's own nest, which indicates an additional effect of maternal genotype. Our results are consistent with the idea that females engage in extra-pair copulations to obtain compatible viability genes, rather than 'good genes' per se.},

While pigment-based ornaments have repeatedly been shown to be condition dependent, this has been more difficult to demonstrate for structural colours. We present evidence for condition dependence of both types of plumage colour in nestling blue tits (Parus caeruleus). Using reflectance spectrometry, we show that blue tit nestlings are sexually dichromatic, with males having more chromatic (more 'saturated') and ultraviolet (LTV)-shifted tail coloration and more chromatic yellow breast coloration. The sexual dimorphism in nestling tail coloration is qualitatively similar to that of chick-feeding adults from the same population. By contrast, the breast plumage of adult birds is not sexually dichromatic in terms of chroma. In nestlings, the chroma of both tail and breast feathers is positively associated with condition (body mass on day 14). The UV/blue hue of the tail feathers is influenced by paternally inherited genes, as indicated by a maternal half-sibling comparison. We conclude that the expression of both carotenoid-based and structural coloration seems to be condition dependent in blue tit nestlings, and that there are additional genetic effects on the hue of the UV/blue tail feathers. The signalling or other functions of sexual dichromatism in nestlings remain obscure. Our study shows that nestling blue tits are suitable model organisms for the study of ontogenetic costs and heritability of both carotenoid-based and structural colour in birds.},

A female's preference for a particular band color was weakly associated with her own bill and plumage measures; females with brighter throat feathers and yellower bills preferred orange bands to blue bands.

We have developed a maximum-likelihood-based method for estimating these error rates from a single replication of a sample of genotypes. Simulations show it to be both accurate and robust to modest violations of its underlying assumptions. We have applied the method to estimating error rates in two microsatellite data sets.

However, few of these studies have investigated the role of diet quality in the growth of wild birds. In this study I investigate the effect of altering nestling diet quality on the growth of a hirundine, the house martin. 2. The quality of the diet fed to nestling house martins was reduced through direct fat feeding. This resulted in a diet of insects and fat which satisfied energy demand while providing fewer nutrients than the usual wholly insect diet. Effects of fat feeding were monitored by recording parental visits, by collecting the faecal Output of broods and by measuring nestling growth. 3. In both years, fat feeding reduced parental feeding visits and fat-free faecal output of broods while producing little alteration in estimated total energy intake. Fat-free faecal mass was positively correlated with an index of parental visits. Mass of fat fed explained most variation in the faecal output of broods. 4. Field metabolic rate of 14-day-old nestlings (mean 54.8 kJ day- 1), measured using the doubly labelled water technique, did not differ between treatments after correction for nestling diet artefacts. 5. Fat-fed broods grew more slowly and were smaller at day 20 and at fledging than control broods even though fledging later. Wing growth was correlated with fat-free faecal output. 6. It was concluded that diet quality differences resulting from fat feeding had caused the difference in nestling growth and that this diet-quality effect may be present in wild bird populations. However, in house martins natural variation in food abundance is probably more important in determining growth than variation in diet quality.},

Perceptual error is thus unlikely to threaten the validity of the handicap principle. Our model represents a step towards greater realism, and also opens up new possibilities for biological signalling theory. Concurrent displays, direct perception of quality, and the evolution of 'amplifiers' and 'attenuators' are all probable features of real signalling systems, yet handicap models based on the assumption of error-free communication cannot accommodate these possibilities.},

In contexts ranging from courtship and mating to parent-offspring communication to predator deterrence, biological signals often involve a number of different visual, auditory and/or olfactory components. Previous models of communication have tended to ignore this complexity, assuming that only one kind of display is available. Here, a new game-theoretical model of signalling is described, in which signallers may use more than one display to advertise their qualities. Additional displays may serve to enhance the accuracy with which receivers assess a single quality (the 'backup signal' hypothesis), or to provide information about different qualities (the 'multiple message' hypothesis). Multiple signals are shown to be stable, even when multiple receiver preferences entail significant costs, provided that signalling costs are strongly accelerating. In such cases, signallers bias their investment towards more efficient forms of signal, but not to the exclusion of other display types. When costs are not strongly accelerating, by contrast, individual signallers employ only a single display at equilibrium. If different signals provide information about different qualities, however, then the equilibrium may feature alternative signalling strategies, with signallers who excel in one quality employing one kind of display, and those who excel in another quality employing another kind.},

Empirical tests of this prediction have, however, yielded equivocal results. Here, I develop a series of evolutionarily stable strategy models of begging as a signal of need, which show that this prediction holds only for competitive aspects of display that influence the division of food among the brood. No such response is expected for cooperative begging ( which influences the total level of provisioning by the parent), and the models even predict the opposite trend under some circumstances ( where the indirect costs of extracting additional resources from the parent are high). These contrasting sets of predictions may help to explain the varying empirical results obtained by studies of sibling interaction. Cooperative ( as opposed to competitive) begging is likely to be of greater significance in cases where dominant young can gain direct control of allocation ( or enjoy some competitive advantage). Dominants are then predicted to parasitize the efforts of their weaker rivals and reduce their own investment in cooperative signaling while continuing to claim a disproportionately large share of the resources provided by the parent.},

We allowed lekking female sandflies, Lutzomyia longipalpis, to choose between males of varying attractiveness to females, and monitored the consequences for their own survival and reproductive success as well as for their offspring. In contrast to the predictions of the direct- benefits model, we found no clear sire effect on the fecundity or survival of the females themselves; females mating with more attractive males did survive longer after oviposition, but never long enough to undertake a second batch of egg laying. We also found no evidence that females gained good-genes benefits in terms of enhanced offspring survival. However, we did find that generally attractive males fathered sons who were then chosen when they in turn formed leks. Although not completely precluding other benefits, our results indicate that Fisherian benefits are at least partly responsible for maintaining female choice at L. longipalpis leks. These findings indicate the importance of testing all putative benefits concurrently in exploring the maintenance of female mate choice.},

If the two training colours arc (to human eyes) red and greenish-yellow or green and blue, chicks prefer intermediates, i.e. orange rather than red or yellow and turquoise rather than green or blue. The level of preference. for intermediate colours implies that the chicks interpolate between the training stimuli. However, they do not extrapolate beyond the limits set by the training stimuli, at least for red and yellow training colours. Similarly, chicks trained to red and blue generalize to purple, but they do not generalize across grey after training to the complementary colours yellow and blue.

   Abstract = {Quantitative genetics theory provides a framework that predicts the effects of selection on a phenotype consisting of a suite of complex traits. However, the ability of existing theory to reconstruct the history of selection or to predict the future trajectory of evolution depends upon the evolutionary dynamics of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix). Thus, the central focus of the emerging field of comparative quantitative genetics is the evolution of the G-matrix. Existing analytical theory reveals little about the dynamics of G, because the problem is too complex to be mathematically tractable. As a first step toward a predictive theory of G-matrix evolution, our goal was to use stochastic computer models to investigate factors that might contribute to the stability of G over evolutionary time. We were concerned with the relatively simple case of two quantitative traits in a population experiencing stabilizing selection, pleiotropic mutation, and random genetic drift. Our results show that G-matrix stability is enhanced by strong correlational selection and large effective population size. In addition, the nature of mutations at pleiotropic loci can dramatically influence stability of G. In particular, when a mutation at a single locus simultaneously changes the value of the two traits (due to pleiotropy) and these effects are correlated, mutation can generate extreme stability of G. Thus, the central message of our study is that the empirical question regarding G-matrix stability is not necessarily a general question of whether G is stable across various taxonomic levels. Rather, we should expect the G-matrix to be extremely stable for some suites of characters and unstable for others over similar spans of evolutionary time.},

   Abstract = {When the environment varies spatially, so that some habitats are more favorable to reproduction than others, an individual should attempt to increase the number of offspring establishing in high-quality habitats. Hence, if male and female dispersal behavior differ, it may be adaptive to produce more offspring of the more dispersing sex in low-quality habitats, since these offspring are likely to disperse to another patch, and more offspring of the most philopatric sex in high-quality habitats, since these offspring are likely to remain in that patch. Such a strategy is shown to be evolutionarily stable provided, that male and female dispersal rates are different and that reproductive success varies between habitats (lack of ideal free distribution). Highly biased sex ratios are predicted (1) in rare habitats, (2) in poor habitats, (3) when difference between habitat quality is large, (4) when at least one sex disperses at a rate close to random with respect to habitat availability, (5) when both sexes disperse at a high rate, (6) when individuals are unable to select their reproducing habitat, and, presumably, (7) with moderate temporal variation of habitat quality. The model appears to be a good candidate to explain the pattern of sex ratio variation in a variety of species: phytophagous arthropods, species with environmental sex determination, and territorial passerines.},

   Abstract = {In some animals, males evolve exaggerated traits (e.g. the peacock's conspicuous tail and display) because of female preference. Recently Enquist and Arak presented a simple neural network model for a visual system in female birds that acquires the ability to discriminate males of the correct species from those of the wrong species by training. They reported that the trained networks were attracted by 'supernormal stimuli' where there was a greater response to an exaggerated form than to the images used as the correct species for training. They suggested that signal recognition mechanisms have an inevitable bias in response, which in turn causes selection on signal form. We here examine the Enquist and Arak model in detail. A three- layered neural network is used to represent the female's mate preference, which consists of 6 x 6 receptor cells arranged on a regular square lattice, ten hidden cells, and one output cell. Connection weights of the network were modified by a genetic algorithm, in which the female's fitness increases if she accepts a conspecific male but decreases if she accepts a male of a different species or a random image. We found that: (i) after the training period the evolved network was able to discriminate male images. Female preference evolves to favour unfamiliar patterns if they are similar to the images of the correct species (generalization); (ii) the speed and the final degree of learning depended critically on the choice of the random images that are rejected. The learning was much less successful if the random images were changed every generation than if 20 random images were fixed throughout the training period; (iii) the male of the same species used for training achieved the highest probability of being accepted by the trained network. Hence, contrary to Enquist and Arak, the evolved network was not attracted by supernormal stimuli.},

   Abstract = {Structural colors result from an interaction between light and the fine-scale physical structure of a surface, and are often extremely bright, chromatic, and iridescent. Given that these visual features depend upon the aggregate abundance and architectural precision of photonic structures, structurally colored sexual ornaments seem well placed to indicate a range of mate quality characteristics. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the signaling potential of structural coloration in the sexually dimorphic butterfly Colias eurytheme. Males of this species display iridescent ultraviolet (UV) markings (arising from multilayer thin films)that overlay a broad area of yellowish-orange pigmentation on their dorsal wing surface. Only the structural UV has demonstrated function as a sexual signal; hence we predicted that it should contain more reliable phenotypic and/or genetic quality information, which would be indicated by phenotypic and/or genetically mediated condition dependence. in two split-family breeding experiments we manipulated condition by exposing full siblings to different stressors at two different juvenile life-history stages: (1) reduced larval host-plant quality and (2) transient heat/cold shocks during metamorphosis. Both stressors had profound effects on key developmental and life-history traits. Each stressor also significantly affected male dorsal coloration; thus, the expression of both structural and pigmentary coloration is phenotypically condition dependent. As predicted, the strongest condition dependence was evident in the brightness and angular visibility (i.e., iridescence) of the UV. Characteristics of both the iridescent UV and pigmentary orange also exhibited moderate-high and significant heritability (H-2 similar to h(2) similar to 0.4-0.9). However, genetic and residual variances did not increase under stress; thus, the observed condition dependence was not genetically mediated as predicted if wing color trait signals "good" genes for the ability to either withstand or circumvent developmental stress. The heightened stress sensitivity of the iridescent UV suggests that it offers an informative lifetime indicator of juvenile environments and, henceforth, adult male phenotypic condition, which may be salient to females seeking a highly fertile and/or nutritious male ejaculate.},

Males could increase their chances of becoming polygynous by actively attracting extra females or by displaying towards visiting floater females. Polygynous males allocated their parental care in relation to the hatching interval between the two broods. If the hatching interval was small, males divided their effort between the primary and the secondary nest, If the hatching interval was large, males fed only the nestlings of the primary female. Primary females that had to share male help did not hedge fewer young, but survived less well. Primary females tried to prevent or delay the settlement of secondary females by behaving aggressively towards all intruder females and by guarding their mates. Secondary females fledged more young if they received more help, that is, if the hatching interval was small, but there was no effect on female survival. Secondary females tried to settle early during the breeding season despite severe aggression of primary females. Secondary females needed less time for nest building and incubation and laid a smaller clutch, which increased the probability of hatching their young early relative to the primary brood. It is concluded that sexual conflicts play an important role in shaping the mating system of the blue tit and that parental care is the key factor in these conflicts.},

However, the benefits that females obtain from extrapair paternity are much less clear. To test the hypothesis that females obtain indirect fitness benefits, we studied paternity in a blue tit population over 4 years. Extrapair paternity occurred in 31-47% of all nests and accounted for 11-14% of all offspring. Most males that fathered extrapair young did not lose paternity themselves, males never ''exchanged'' paternity, and within nests the extrapair offspring were usually fathered by a single male. Comparisons between males that did and did not lose paternity and pairwise comparisons between the extrapair male(s) and the within-pair male showed that successful males had longer tarsi and sang on average longer strophes during the dawn chorus. Successful males weighed less (relative to their size) during the nestling stage, but nevertheless they survived better: Male age did not influence their likelihood of losing paternity, but extrapair males were usually older than the within-pair male they cuckolded. Within nests with mixed paternity extrapair young were more likely to survive than within-pair young in cases of partial brood mortality. Our data also suggest that extrapair offspring were more likely to be males. Because extrapair males were usually close neighbors, male quality should be considered relative to the quality of the neighbors. Despite this, we found consistency in female choice over years. Our observations provide support for the hypothesis that female blue tits engage in extrapair copulations to obtain good genes for their offspring.},

   Abstract = {We approach conceptual issues in evolutionary biology from an endocrinological perspective, noting that single hormones typically act on several target tissues and thereby mediate suites of correlated phenotypic traits. When several components of such a suite are beneficial, an important evolutionary question is whether all are adaptations or some are exaptations. The answer may depend oil whether the traits arose in response to selection on variation in systemic levels of the hormone on variation in responsiveness of target tissues to invariant levels of the hormone. If the former, se lection probably acted directly on fewer than all traits; beneficial traits arising indirectly would be exaptations. In contrast, multiple beneficial traits that arose out of independent changes in target-tissue sensitivity to invariant hormone levels could all be adaptations. Knowledge of specific hormonal mechanisms as well as of historical selective regimes will be necessary to draw such distinctions. Endocrine constraints on evolution can be studied experimentally by applying hormones systemically and measuring interdependent responses of beneficial and detrimental trails to selection (phenotypic engineering with hormones). Supposing that alteration of one trait in isolation would enhance fitness, cases in which the net effect of endocrine alteration of multiple trails is to depress fitness provide evidence for constraints. We briefly report results of recent studies employing hormonal manipulations, stressing our own work on the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis: Emberizidae).},

   Abstract = {After years of investigation into the function of sexually dimorphic ornamental traits, researchers are beginning to understand how bright plumage colour in birds acts as an intraspecific signal. This work has focused primarily on pigment-based ornaments because they are highly variable in patch size, hue and brightness for some species. In contrast, structurally based ornaments have been little studied, in part because they do not appear to be as variable as pigment-based ornaments. We investigated a structurally based plumage ornament in a wild population of blue grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), a sexually dimorphic passerine. We report plumage variation that extends into the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The pattern of covariation between four out of five elements of plumage variation suggests that structurally based ornamentation is pushed towards extreme expression of the trait as predicted by the sexual selection theory. The 'bluest' birds have the highest percentage of blue feathers on the body. These ornamental feathers reflect light maximally at the shortest wavelengths (ultraviolet), with the greatest intensity and the greatest contrast. Age may have some effect on expression of blueness. In addition, plumage variables are correlated with growth bars in tail feathers (a record of nutritional condition during moult in a nonornamental trait). This suggests that the ornament is partially condition dependent. Thus, blue plumage in male grosbeaks may serve as an honest indicator of age and quality.},

   Abstract = {We investigated the signaling function of blue plumage in male blue grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea) to determine if structurally based coloration may act as a reliable signal of quality to conspecifics. Blue plumage results from the microstructure of feather barbules rather than from pigment granules, and thus it is possible that structurally based plumage ornaments may function differently from sexually selected ornamental coloration that is pigment based. The plumage of male blue grosbeaks reflects maximally in the blue-ultraviolet range, so most variation in plumage coloration among males is invisible to human observers. In previous research, we showed that increased area of blue plumage on the body is associated with a shift in the wavelength of maximum feather reflectance toward the ultraviolet and with high intensity of light reflected at that maximum, and that extreme expression of the male ornament is condition dependent. These observations suggest that blue plumage may be an honest advertisement of male quality. We tested this hypothesis in a wild population of blue grosbeaks. We quantified male quality in three broad categories. (1) Physical condition was assessed from subcutaneous fat deposits, ectoparasite load, and body size. (2) Territory quality was assessed from territory area, prey abundance, and predation risk. (3) Paternal investment was assessed from male feeding rate. We found that the bluest males have the largest body size, maintain the largest territories with the greatest prey abundance, and feed nestlings in the first nest of the season at the highest rates.

In this field experiment we investigated the possible trade-offs between immune function and sexual advertisement by manipulating both mating effort and activity of immune defence in male pied flycatchers. Mating effort was increased in a non- arbitrary manner by removing females from mated males during nest building. Widowed males sustained higher haematocrit levels than control males and showed higher expression of forehead patch height, suggesting that manipulation succeeded in increasing mating effort. Males that were experimentally forced to increase mating effort had reduced humoral immune responsiveness compared with control males. In addition, experimental activation of immune defence by vaccination with novel antigens reduced the expression of male ornament dimensions. To conclude, our results indicate that causality behind the trade-off between immune function and sexual advertisement may work in both directions: sexual activity suppresses immune function but immune challenge also reduces sexual advertisement.},

We use one specific empirical example - thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rates of caterpillars - to demonstrate how models for function-valued traits are natural extensions of more familiar, multivariate models for correlated, quantitative traits. We emphasize three main points. First, because function-valued traits are continuous functions, there are important constraints on their patterns of variation that are not captured by multivariate models. Phenotypic and genetic variation in function-valued traits can be quantified in terms of variance-covariance functions and their associated eigenfunctions: we illustrate how these are estimated as well as their biological interpretations for TPCs. Second, selection on a function-valued trait is itself a function, defined in terms of selection gradient functions. For TPCs, the selection gradient describes how the relationship between an organism's performance and its fitness varies as a function of its temperature. We show how the form of the selection gradient function for TPCs relates to the frequency distribution of environmental states (caterpillar temperatures) during selection. Third, we can predict evolutionary responses of function-valued traits in terms of the genetic variance-covariance and the selection gradient functions. We illustrate how non-linear evolutionary responses of TPCs may occur even when the mean phenotype and the selection gradient are themselves linear functions of temperature. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological and empirical challenges for future studies of the evolution of function-valued traits.},

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients \beta\ were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of \beta\ for selection on morphological and on life- history/ phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/ life history. Similarly, the values of \beta\ for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients \gamma\ were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of gamma values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

For size, more than 79% of selection estimates exceed zero, whereas for other morphological traits positive and negative values are similar in frequency. The selective advantage of increased size occurs for traits implicated in both natural selection (e.g., differences in survival) and sexual selection (e.g., differences in mating success).

   Abstract = {We compiled a database of microevolution on contemporary time scales in nature (47 source articles; 30 animal species), comprising 2649 evolutionary rates in darwins (proportional change per million years) and 2151 evolutionary rates in haldanes (standard deviations per generation). Here we demonstrate how quantitative rate measures can provide general insights into patterns and processes of evolution. The frequency distribution of evolutionary rates was approximately log-normal, with many slow rates and few fast rates. Net selection intensities estimated from haldanes were on average lower than selection intensities commonly measured directly in natural populations. This difference suggests that natural selection could easily accomplish observed microevolution but that the intensities of selection typically measured in nature are rarely maintained for long (otherwise observed evolutionary rates would be higher). Traits closely associated with fitness (life history traits) appear to evolve at least as fast as traits less closely tied to fitness (morphology). The magnitude of evolutionary difference increased with the length of the time interval, particularly when maximum rates from a given study were considered. This pattern suggests a general underlying tendency toward increasing evolutionary diversification with time. However, evolutionary rates also tended to decrease with time, perhaps because longer time intervals average increasingly disparate rates over time, or because evolution slows when populations approach new optima or as genetic variation is depleted. In combination, our results suggest that macroevolutionary transitions may ultimately arise through microevolution occasionally 'writ large' but are perhaps temporally characterized by microevolution 'writ in fits and starts'.},

   Abstract = {We present a quantitative genetic model for the evolution of growth trajectories that makes no assumptions about the shapes of growth trajectories that are possible. Evolution of a population's mean growth trajectory is governed by the selection gradient function and the additive genetic covariance function. The selection gradient function is determined by the impact of changes in size on the birth and death rates at different ages, and can be estimated for natural populations. The additive genetic covariance function can also be estimated empirically, as we demonstrate with four vertebrate populations. Using the genetic data from mice, a computer simulation shows that evolution of a growth trajectory can be constrained by the absence of genetic variation for certain changes in the trajectory's shape. These constraints can be visualized with an analysis of the covariance function. Results from four vertebrate populations show that while each has substantial genetic variation for some evolutionary changes in its growth trajectory, most types of changes have little or no variation available. This suggests that constraints may often play an important role in the evolution of growth.},

The expression of a male display trait is proportional to genetic quality, which is determined by the number of deleterious mutations a male carries throughout his genome. Genetic Variances and covariances, including the covariance between the preference and male trait that drives the good genes process, are allowed to evolve under an infinitesimal model. Results suggest that the good genes process generates only weak indirect selection on preferences, with an effective selection intensity of a few percent or less. If preferences are subject to direct natural selection of the intensity observed for other characters, the good genes process alone is not expected to exaggerate the male trait by more than a few phenotypic standard deviations, contrary to what is observed in highly sexually selected species. Good genes can, however, cause substantial exaggeration if preference genes are nearly selectively neutral. Alternatively, direct selection on preference genes, acting on mating behavior itself or on the genes' pleiotropic effects, can cause mating preferences and male display traits to be exaggerated by any degree. Direct selection of preference genes may therefore play an important role in species that show extreme sexual selection.},

In conjunction with the limited data now available, it suggests that the evolutionary force generated by indirect selection on preferences is weak in absolute terms.

Here, we introduce a statistical model especially designed to deal with this complexity. The common principal component (CPC) model for dependent random vectors is based on the assumption that the same pattern underlies both variation within stages and covariation across stages. Thus, a single transformation, when applied to all stages, renders the resulting CPCs uncorrelated not only within but also across stages. Because of these simplifying assumptions, the CPC model greatly reduces the number of parameters to be estimated; it is thus an efficient tool for data reduction. This model is demonstrated using growth of the water strider Limnoporus canaliculatus. The CPCs can be interpreted as patterns of ''size'' variation and contrasts between parts that are common to all stages, although there are minor deviations from the model. The ''size'' CPC accounts for most variation in all instars and is therefore an effective measure of overall growth. Moreover, the CPC model clarifies the link between static and ontogenetic variation by including both levels in a joint analysis and can be used to study morphological integration and constraints on the evolution of ontogenies.},

We propose an approach to investigate the role of development for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the patterns of covariance among landmarks. This approach extends the notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks. We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within- individual variability) and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry. We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to be involved in the development of fly wings.},

   Abstract = {The connection between development and evolution has become the focus of an increasing amount of research in recent years, and heterochrony has long been a key concept in this relation. Heterochrony is defined as evolutionary change in rates and timing of developmental processes; the dimension of time is therefore an essential part in studies of heterochrony. Over the past two decades, evolutionary biologists have used several methodological frameworks to analyse heterochrony, which differ substantially in the way they characterize evolutionary changes in ontogenies and in the resulting classification, although they mostly use the same terms. This review examines how these methods compare ancestral and descendant ontogenies, emphasizing their differences and the potential for contradictory results from analyses using different frameworks. One of the two principal methods uses a clock as a graphical display for comparisons of size, shape and age at a particular ontogenic stage, whereas the other characterizes a developmental process by its time of onset, rate, and time of cessation. The literature on human heterochrony provides particularly clear examples of how these differences produce apparent contradictions when applied to the same problem. Developmental biologists recently have extended the concept of heterochrony to the earliest stages of development and have applied it at the cellular and molecular scale. This extension brought considerations of developmental mechanisms and genetics into the study of heterochrony, which previously was based primarily on phenomenological characterizations of morphological change in ontogeny. Allometry is the pattern of covariation among several morphological traits or between measures of size and shape; unlike heterochrony, allometry does not deal with time explicitly. Two main approaches to the study of allometry are distinguished, which differ in the way they characterize organismal form. One approach defines shape as proportions among measurements, based on considerations of geometric similarity, whereas the other focuses on the covariation among measurements in ontogeny and evolution. Both are related conceptually and through the use of similar algebra. In addition, there are close connections between heterochrony and changes in allometric growth trajectories, although there is no one-to-one correspondence. These relationships and outline links between different analytical frameworks are discussed.},

The data are the positions of 11 landmarks on the mandibles of 1241 mice from a parent-offspring breeding design. We use Procrustes superimposition to extract shape variation and restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the additive genetic and environmental components of variance and covariance. Matrix permutation tests showed that the genetic and phenotypic as well as the genetic and environmental covariance matrices were similar, but not identical. Likewise, principal component analyses revealed correspondence in the patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation. Patterns revealed in these analyses also showed similarities to features previously found in the effects of quantitative trait loci and in the phenotypes generated in gene knockout experiments. We used the multivariate version of the breeders' equation to explore the potential for short-term response to selection on shape. In general, the correlated response is substantial and regularly exceeds the direct response: Selection applied locally to one landmark usually produces a response in other parts of the mandible as well. Moreover, even selection for shifts of the same landmark in different directions can yield dramatically different responses. These results demonstrate the role of the geometry and anatomical structure of the mandible, which are key determinants of the patterns of the genetic and phenotypic covariance matrices, in molding the potential for adaptive evolution.},

We used the techniques of geometric morphometrics (Procrustes superimposition) to analyze the variation of landmark configurations in fore- and hindwings. Regression was used to correct for size-related shape variation (allometry). Principal component analysis revealed patterns of variation that were remarkably similar for individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Because covariation of FA among parts must be due to direct transmission of the developmental perturbations causing FA, this agreement of patterns suggests that much of individual variation is also due to direct developmental interactions within each developing wing. Moreover, partial least squares analysis indicated that the patterns of shape covariation between fore- and hindwings were nearly the same as the patterns of within-wing variation. Shape covariation of FA was only found in bees that had been reared under elevated CO2 concentration but not in bees from the control treatment, suggesting that the mechanisms of developmental interactions between fore- and hindwings are related to gas exchange. We conclude that the fore- and hindwings are developmental modules that maintain internal coherence through direct developmental interactions and are connected to each other only by relatively few links that use the system of interactions within modules.},

Data from the fossil record have subsequently been examined for several other taxonomic groups to determine whether they also displayed an evolutionary increase in body size. However, we are not aware of any species-level study that has investigated the evolution of body size within an extant continental group. Data acquired from the fossil record and data derived from the evolutionary relationships of extant species are not similar, with each set exhibiting both strengths and weaknesses related to inferring evolutionary patterns. Consequently, expectation that general trends exhibited in the fossil record will correspond to patterns in extant groups is not necessarily warranted. Using phylogenetic relationships of extant species, we show that five of nine families of North American freshwater fishes exhibit an evolutionary trend of decreasing body size. These trends result from the basal position of large species and the more derived position of small species within families. Such trends may be caused by the invasion of small streams and subsequent isolation and speciation. This pattern, potentially influenced by size-biased dispersal rates and the high percentage of small streams in North America, suggests a scenario that could result in the generation of the size-frequency distribution of North American freshwater fishes.},

Here we present a new Bayesian estimator that simultaneously estimates the pedigree and the size of the unsampled population. The method is robust to genotyping error, and can estimate pedigrees in the absence of demographic data. Using a large-scale microsatellite assay in four wild cichlid fish populations of Lake Tanganyika (1000 individuals in total), we assess the performance of the Bayesian estimator against the most popular assignment program, Cervus. We found small but significant pedigrees in each of the tested populations using the Bayesian procedure, but Cervus had very high type I error rates when the size of the unsampled population was assumed to be lower than what it was. The need of pedigree relationships to infer adaptive processes in natural populations places strong constraints on sampling design and identification of multigenerational pedigrees in natural populations.},

To study the effect of multiple trait breeding value estimation on genetic gain, a riding horse population under sequential selection was stochastically simulated for station test performance and competition performance of progeny, and genetic evaluation was compared for uni- and bivariate models as well as for sire- and animal models. Genetic response of the univariate animal model was higher than response under the bivariate sire model.

In contrast, a quantitative genetic model of the relationship between age and breeding value of fitness casts strong doubts on the mechanism. The present analysis shows, however, that these doubts are mainly the result of assuming that all variation among individuals arises from differences in allocation between components of fitness. This neglects the possibility of variability in condition as a whole. Instead, when allowing for persistent variability in condition and assuming optimal reaction norms in allocation, it is shown that correlations between survival and genetic quality or fitness can easily be established at all ages. On the other hand, the results also suggest that the validity of verbal arguments is limited, and counterexamples can be generated where low-quality individuals should invest more in survival. Therefore, resolution of the old age indicator problem requires specification of the constraints acting on life-history characteristics.},

The good-parent process predicts the evolution of honest signals of parental investment, whereas the differential-allocation model suggests a trade-off between the attractiveness of a mate and his care-provisioning. I show that both alternatives can arise from optimal allocations to advertisement, parental investment and future reproductive value of the male, and that the male's marginal fitness gain from multiple matings determines which option should apply. The marginal gain is diminishing if opportunities for polygyny or extra-pair copulations are limited. Advertisement is then expected to be modest and honest, indicating genetic quality and condition-dependent parental investment simultaneously. Increasing marginal gains are likely to be related to cases where genetic quality has a significant influence on offspring fitness. This alternative leads to differential allocation with stronger advertisement, more frequent extra-pair copulations, and diminished male care. Reliability is also reduced if allocation benefits have thresholds, e.g. if there is a minimum body condition required for survival, or if females use a polygyny-threshold strategy of mate choice.},

   Abstract = {"Good genes" models of mate choice are commonly tested by examining whether attractive males sire offspring with improved survival. If offspring do not survive better (or indeed survive less well), but instead inherit the attractiveness of their father, results are typically interpreted to support the Fisherian process, which allows the evolution of preferences for arbitrary traits. Here, I show that the above view is mistaken. Because of life-history trade-offs, an attractive male may perform less well in other components of fitness. A female obtains a "good genes" benefit whenever males show heritable variation in quality, even if high-quality males invest so much in sexual advertisement that attractiveness has no positive correlation with any other life-history trait than male mating success itself. Therefore, a negative correlation between attractiveness and viability does not falsify good genes, if mating with a high-quality male results on average in superior offspring performance (mating success of sons included). The heritable "good genes" benefit can be sustained even if sexually antagonistic genes cause female offspring sired by high-quality males to survive and reproduce less well. Neglecting the component of male mating success from measurements of fitness returns from sons and daughters will bias the advantage of mating with a high-quality male downwards. This result may partly account for the rather weak "good genes" effects found in a recent meta-analysis.},

These hypotheses are often pitted against each other as alternatives, with evidence that attractive males sire more viable offspring interpreted as support for good genes and with a negative or null relationship between mating success of sons and other components of fitness interpreted as favouring the Fisher process. Here, we build a general model of female choice for indirect benefits that captures the essence of both the 'Fisherian' and 'good-genes' models. All versions of our model point to a single process that favours female preference for males siring offspring of high reproductive value. Enhanced mating success and survival are therefore equally valid genetic benefits of mate choice, but their relative importance varies depending on female choice costs. The relationship between male attractiveness and survival may be positive or negative, depending on life-history trade-offs and mating skew. This relationship can change sign in response to increased costliness of choice or environmental change. Any form of female preference is subject to self- reinforcing evolution, and any relationship (or lack thereof) between male display and offspring survival is inevitably an indicator of offspring reproductive values. Costly female choice can be maintained with or without higher offspring survival.},

This view has been challenged by Kokko and Monaghan, who argue that sex-specific parental investment, mortalities, mate-encounter rates and quality variation determine the mating system in a way that is not reducible to the OSR. We develop a game-theoretic model of choosiness, signalling and parental care, to examine (i) whether the results of Kokko and Monaghan remain robust when its simplifying assumptions are relaxed, (ii) how parental care coevolves with mating strategies and the OSR and (iii) why mutual mate choice is observed relatively rarely even when both sexes vary in quality. We find qualitative agreement with the simpler approach: parental investment is the primary determinant of sex roles instead of the OSR, and factors promoting choosiness are high species-specific mate-encounter rate, high sex-specific mate-encounter rate, high cost of breeding (parental investment), low cost of mate searching and highly variable quality of the opposite sex. The coevolution of parental care and mating strategies hinders mutual mate choice if one parent can compensate for reduced care by the other, but promotes it if offspring survival depends greatly on biparental care. We argue that the relative rarity of mutual mate choice is not due to biases in the OSR. Instead, we describe processes by which sexual strategies tend to diverge. This divergence is prevented, and mutual mate choice maintained, if synergistic benefits of biparental care render parental investment both high and not too different in the two sexes.},

   Abstract = {Calls to understand the links between ecology and evolution have been common for decades. Population dynamics, i.e. the demographic changes in populations, arise from life history decisions of individuals and thus are a product of selection, and selection, on the contrary, can be modified by such dynamical properties of the population as density and stability. It follows that generating predictions and testing them correctly requires considering this ecogenetic feedback loop whenever traits have demographic consequences, mediated via density dependence (or frequency dependence). This is not an easy challenge, and arguably theory has advanced at a greater pace than empirical research. However, theory would benefit from more interaction between related fields, as is evident in the many near-synonymous names that the ecogenetic loop has attracted. We also list encouraging examples where empiricists have shown feasible ways of addressing the question, ranging from advanced data analysis to experiments and comparative analyses of phylogenetic data.},

Using a combination of cross-fostering and begging playback experiments, we show that, in the great tit (Parus major), (i) the begging call intensity of nestlings depends on their common origin, suggesting genetic variation for this begging display, (ii) only mothers respond to begging calls by increased food provisioning, and (iii! the size of the parental response is positively related to the begging call intensity of nestlings in the maternal but not paternal line. This study indicates that genetic covariation, its differential expression in the maternal and paternal lines and/or early environmental and parental effects need to be taken into account when predicting the phenotypic outcome of the conflict over investment between genes expressed in each parent and the offspring.},

   Abstract = {When ontogeny takes place in a family, and parents provide essential resources for development, the parents become an environmental component to the development of a wide range of offspring traits. Because differences among parents may partly reflect genetic variation, this environmental component contains genes and may itself evolve. Also, when offspring play an active role in family interactions, offspring become a social environmental component to parents, affecting their behavior in turn, which potentially results in reciprocal social selection. Thus, an evolutionary process of coadaptation to family life, additionally driven by conflicts of interests, may have shaped the expression and development patterns underlying infant behaviors. The complex genetics arising from family interactions can be formalized by extending standard quantitative genetic models. These models demonstrate how the explicit consideration of the family environment can profoundly alter both the expression and evolutionary response to selection of behaviors involved in family interactions. Behavioral genetic studies have begun to unravel the complex genetics underlying infant solicitation behaviors and parental provisioning, although many focus on one side of the interaction. A genetic analysis incorporating interactions among family members explicitly may be critical because the genes underlying the expression of parental provisioning indirectly affect offspring behaviors, and vice versa.},

Comparisons of group size and reproductive success on a given quality territory suggest that the presence of alloparents (helpers and cobreeders) significantly affects the reproductive success of their parents. The influence of alloparents on reproductive success was examined by removing alloparents from breeding units and comparing the success of natural-sized and artificially reduced groups. Removal experiments, controlled for territory quality, group size and breeder age, showed that the presence of one alloparent significantly improved the reproductive success of its parents. Analysis strongly suggests that this was entirely due to helping behaviour (i.e. providing care to offspring of their parents), thereby improving the helper's inclusive fitness benefits from staying at home. However, these experiments showed also that the presence of two or more alloparents in medium-quality territories significantly decreased reproductive success, compared with groups with one alloparent. Several lines of evidence suggest that this may have been due to the joint-nesting and reproductive competition that could occur in breeding groups, or simply to resource depression when a large number of previous offspring remained on their natal territory.},

Transfers of warblers to unoccupied islands showed that both habitat saturation and variation in territory quality dramatically affected the frequency of delayed dispersal. At first there was no cooperative breeding, but as all high-quality areas became occupied, young birds hatched on them began to stay as helpers, rather than occupy breeding vacancies on lower quality territories. However, as the number of helpers on high-quality territories increased, thereby reducing the helper's indirect component of inclusive fitness benefits from staying at home, it paid some helpers to leave, even to poor territories.

   Abstract = {I studied age-related breeding performance of the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) on Cousin Island, Seychelles, during 14 years. The annual number of young that fledged is significantly related to territory quality and number of helpers in the breeding group. Accounting for these factors and for the partner's breeding experience, annual production of fledglings by breeding birds increases from 2 to 5 years and decreases beyond 5 years of age. Age- related changes in reproductive success within breeding individuals, paired with the same experienced partner and occupying the same breeding territory with similar amount of food from 2 to 8 years of age, show that Seychelles warblers have higher hatching success and produce more hatchlings and fledglings as they become older. This is probably not a response to decreasing residual reproductive value caused by decreasing life expectancy as they become older. Primiparous warblers produce the same number of fledglings as multiparous warblers of the same age, have a similar life expectancy as multiparous warblers, and occupy territories with similar amounts of resources available for reproduction. As all warblers have similar access to food before reproduction and similar foraging efficiency, the low reproductive success in younger warblers cannot be ascribed to differences in environment but to the bird's ability to breed successfully (e.g., a result of previous helping and/or breeding experience). Effects of senescence on reproduction begin to occur from age 6 for both sexes. From that age, eggs have lower hatching success, but fledging success remains the same. Birds that start breeding at a young age on a given quality territory produce more fledglings in their lifetime than birds that delay breeding. Many old birds never fledge young of their own. They have not been able to breed because of a shortage of breeding territory vacancies.},

This age effect is not due to differential survival or increased reproductive effort, but to accumulated helping and breeding experience. In their first year of breeding, reproductive performance of inexperienced warblers with neither helping nor breeding experience was significantly lower than that of warblers of the same age with either previous helping or breeding experience. Reproductive performance was the same for primiparae with helping experience and for birds with breeding experience. Female primiparae with helping experience or breeding experience built better nests and spent more time incubating than inexperienced females, which led to increased hatching success. Male primiparae with helping experience or males with breeding experience guarded the clutch better than inexperienced males, which led to reduced egg predation. Even- aged warblers with different previous experiences were transferred to unoccupied islands, where birds started breeding immediately in high-quality territories. The experiment showed that birds with helping experience produced their first fledgling as fast as experienced breeders, and significantly faster than inexperienced birds. Breeding performance did not improve further with experience after the first successful breeding attempt. Only birds with previous breeding experience who paired with inexperienced birds, were likely to change mate. The other pair combinations remained stable. Thus, primiparous birds with helping experience have greater lifetime reproductive success than inexperienced primiparae of the same age. This experiment shows that helping behavior has not only been selected for in the context of promoting an individual's indirect fitness, but also in the context of gaining helping experience which translates into improved reproductive success when a helper becomes a breeder.},

There is evidence that the biased sex ratio is caused by biased production, and not because of biased mortality at younger ages: (i) cumulative mortality from the egg stage to the stage at six months of age is insufficient to generate a consistent deviation from sex ratio parity; (ii) all 30 nestlings produced by two pairs on low-quality territories survived to be sexed as sons, and all nestlings produced by two pairs on high-quality territories survived to be sexed as 17 daughters and one son; and (iii) in addition, breeding pairs that were transferred from low- to high-quality territories, switched from the production of male to female nestlings.},

By modifying offspring sex ratio, parents maximize their inclusive fitness benefits. Pairs in high-quality territories gained significantly more inclusive fitness benefits (through helping and reproducing offspring) from the production of daughters than from sons, and vice versa in low-quality territories (through reproducing offspring). Experimental manipulation of the offspring's sex shows that the consequences of sex allocation are adaptive for parents on high-quality territories.

On the islands of Cousin and Cousine, with equal densities of Seychelles fodies (Foudia sechellarum), nearly 75% of artificial eggs placed in artificial nests were predated by fodies after 3 days. On Aride Island with no fodies present, loss of artificial eggs was not observed. Female warblers incubate the clutch, and male warblers guard the clutch when females are absent. Deterrence of fodies by male warblers is efficient: loss rate of eggs from unattended warbler nests was seven times as high as from attended nests, and the more nest guarding, the lower the egg loss and the higher the hatching success. Egg loss is independent of the amount of incubation by females. There is no trade-off between incubating and foraging by females. Nest guarding competes with foraging by males, and this trade-off has a more pronounced effect on egg loss when food availability is low The transfer of breeding pairs from Cousin to either Cousine with egg-predating fodies or to Aride without fodies allowed us ro experimentally investigate the presumed trade-off between nest guarding and foraging. On Cousine, individual males spent the same amount of time nest guarding and foraging as on Cousin, and egg loss was similar and inversely related to rime spent nest guarding as on Cousin. Males that guarded their clutch on Cousin did not guard the clutch on Aride bur allocated significantly more time to foraging and gained better body condition. Loss of warbler eggs on Aride was not observed. Time allocation to incubating and for-aging by individual females before and after both translocations remained the same.},

Male warblers do not assure their paternity through frequent copulations to devalue any sperm from other males: males do not copulate with their partners immediately following a successful EPC obtained by their partners, the frequency of successful within-pair copulations does not increase with the frequency of successful EPCs and females initiate all successful copulations and are capable of resisting copulation attempts.},

The importance of helping or territory budding as a determinant of lifetime reproductive success (LRS) has been debated because the potential benefits of both strategies could not be separated. Here we test the causes and the immediate and future fitness consequences of single dispersal decisions taken by male Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis). Males breeding in high-quality territories (high food abundance) have significantly higher LRS than similar-aged males budding off part of the parental territory. Initially, budders have a low reproductive success (because of limited food resources or absence of a breeding partner). However, they have a long life span and inherit high- quality territories through site dominance, by which they gain higher LRS than breeders on low-quality territories, helpers, or floaters. Experimental creation of male breeding territory vacancies showed that most young males became budders because of intense competition for high-quality territories. The translocation of warblers to the previously unoccupied Aride Island shows that males behave according to the expected fitness benefits of each dispersal strategy. In the absence of competition for territories on Aride, all young males bred in high-quality territories. However, after saturation of high- quality habitat with territories, most males became budders rather than breeders on low-quality habitat, helpers, or floaters.},

Neighbouring males are the primary threat to a male's genetic paternity. Males minimize their loss of paternity by guarding their mates to prevent them from having extra-pair copulations during their fertile period. Here, I provide experimental evidence that mate-guarding behaviour is energetically costly and that the expression of this trade-off is adjusted to paternity risk (local male density). Free-living males that were induced to reduce mate guarding spent significantly more time foraging and gained significantly better body condition than control males. The larger the reduction in mate guarding, the more pronounced was the increase in foraging and body condition (accounting for food availability). An experimental increase in paternity risk resulted in an increase in mate-guarding intensity and a decrease in foraging and body condition, and vice versa. This is examined using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.

Future budders had significantly more aggressive interactions with neighbours and assisted their parents more with territory defence than similarly aged future alloparents or non-helpers. This led to an increase of the natal territory of future budders before actual budding took place, whereas the natal territories of future alloparents remained constant in size. Alloparents never became budders and vice versa, refuting partial inheritance as an advantage of alloparenting. Natural male breeding vacancies were never inherited by alloparents born on vacant or other territories, but were inherited by budders born on the vacant territory or, if these were absent, predominantly by budders from neighbouring territories. We offer explicit experimental evidence against the 'helping at the nest to inherit' hypothesis.

Although several mechanisms have been put forward to explain how females might control the sex of their eggs, virtually nothing is known. As females are the heterogametic sex in birds, adjustment of the clutch sex ratio could arise either by pre- or post-ovulation control mechanisms. The Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) exhibits extreme adaptive egg sex ratio bias. Typically, warblers produce only single-egg clutches, but by translocating pairs to vacant habitat of very high quality, most females were induced to produce two-egg clutches. Overall, females skewed clutch sex ratios strongly towards daughters (86.6%). This bias was evident in the first egg, but critically, also in the second eggs laid a day apart, even when all absent, unhatched, or unsexed second eggs were assumed to be male. Although a bias in the first egg may arise through either pre- or post-ovulation mechanisms, the skew observed in second eggs could only arise through pre-ovulation control. Post-ovulation adjustment may also contribute to skewed hatchling sex ratios, but as sex-biased release of gametes is likely to be a more efficient process of control, pre-ovulation mechanisms may be the sole means of adjustment in this species. High fitness differentials between sons and daughters, as apparent in the Seychelles warblers, may be necessary for primary sex ratio adjustment to evolve.},

Additional breeding populations were successfully established on the islands of Aride (68 ha, 1988) and Cousine (26 ha, 1990) and now with the existence of ca. 2000 warblers on three islands the conservation status of the warbler has improved from endangered to vulnerable. Emigration from the island is extremely rare, so birds that disappeared were known to have died. Almost every bird on Cousin Island has been individually colour ringed and monitored throughout all breeding attempts during a 17-year period (1985-2002; total ca. 2400 birds). These birds were also blood sampled for molecular parentage and sex analyses. Therefore the lifetime reproductive success of many birds is known. Although warblers can breed independently in their first year, some individuals remain in their natal territory as subordinates, and often help by providing nourishment to non- descendant offspring. The frequency of 'helping' is affected by habitat saturation and variation in territory quality (insect prey availability). The long-term benefits of helping are higher for daughters than for sons, and it is therefore no wonder that most helpers are daughters from previous broods. Furthermore, on low-quality territories breeding pairs raising sons gain higher fitness benefits than by raising daughters, and vice versa on high-quality territories. Female breeders adaptively modify the sex of their single-egg clutches according to territory quality: male eggs on low quality and female eggs on high quality. The Seychelles warbler is a beautiful example of behavioural and life-history adaptations to restricted circumstances.},

Help seems to be based on the continued presence of the primary female who previously fed the subordinate in the nest but it has, so far, been impossible to discount the direct assessment of genetic relatedness. We used a cross-fostering experiment to separate the two possible cues. Adult birds did not discriminate between their own and cross-fostered eggs or nestlings. Cross-fostering resulted in nestlings that were unrelated to the primary female that raised them, but control nestlings were closely related to their primary females. The proportions of cross-fostered and control female offspring that stayed and became helpers on their 'natal' territory were similar. However, for both groups the chance of becoming a subordinate helper was associated with the continued presence of the primary female and not with any other factor tested.

Correlations between paired genetic and phenotypic correlation estimates were generally found to be high (from 0.87 to 0.95) and not statistically different between the two species. Employment of a paired sample t -test showed that the average difference between the genetic and phenotypic correlation estimates (d = r (G) - r (P) ) was significantly (p < 0.05) different from zero only for dairy goats (d = 0.11). Comparisons of correlation estimates either after employment of Fisher's transformation or of a non-parametric test (Kruskall- Wallis) showed that there was statistically no significant difference (p < 0.05) between the two estimates. The main sources of variation for pooled (sheep and goat) d were the year of publication, the method of estimation and the heritabilities of the traits. Furthermore, differences between the two estimates were caused by sampling errors of the genetic correlations. Although average reported standard errors of genetic correlations were found to be about 30% higher than the theoretically expected correlations, the difference between the two errors was not statistically significant (p < 0.05). A simulation study of two correlated traits displaying heritabilities, genetic, environmental and phenotypic correlations equal to the average literature estimates was also performed to investigate the effects of using r (P) instead of r (G) on the direct and indirect true selection responses and on the accuracy of the breeding values. Based on the results of the descriptive and simulation analysis for the species, traits and correlation structure examined here, phenotypic correlations may be substituted for genetic correlations when the latter are unavailable or are not precisely estimated.},

We examined the flexibility of the developmental programme of Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) nestlings by subjecting them to food restriction, and realimentation between 3-5 and 5-7 days of age, respectively, or overfeeding between 3 and 7 days of age. 2. Food restriction resulted in a marked reduction of body mass and intestinal mass, but not pectoral muscle mass and tarsus length. Refed nestlings were unable to catch up with body mass of overfed young. None of the feeding regimes had much effect on the rate of maturation, measured here by the water content of muscle tissue. 3. Thus, the nestlings were unable to respond actively to changing food availability by slowing the pace of development and subsequent compensatory growth. 4. Body-mass increments levelled off with increasing energy intake, which suggests that overfed nestlings had reached physiological limits with respect to the rate of biomass production. Yet they did not grow faster than nestlings in the wild. 5. Growth of the young under natural conditions is therefore likely to be limited by physiological or anatomical constraints, rather than food availability. This, along with the absence of the mechanisms that would increase the likelihood of surviving through short periods of food shortage, indirectly suggest that at least in some altricial bird species food shortages do not occur frequently enough to select for responses to unpredictability of food resources.},

The distribution of both heritability estimates and genetic correlation estimates, when plotted against estimated accuracy, was consistent with random error variance being some three times the sampling variance predicted from standard formulae. This result was consistent with the observation that the variance of estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations between populations were about four times the predicted sampling variance, suggesting few real differences in genetic parameters between populations. Except where there was a strong biological or statistical expectation of a difference, there was little evidence for differences between genetic and phenotypic correlations for most trait combinations or for differences in genetic correlations between populations. These results suggest that, even for controlled populations, estimating genetic parameters specific to a given population is less useful than commonly believed. A serendipitous discovery was that, in the standard formula for theoretical standard error of a genetic correlation estimate, the heritabilities refer to the estimated values and not, as seems generally assumed, the true population values.},

Allowances are made for unequal models, unknown covariance matrices and missing data. Having outlined the theory, strategies for implementation are reviewed. These include joint sampling of location parameters; efficient sampling from the fully conditional posterior distribution of augmented data, a multivariate truncated normal distribution; and sampling from the conditional inverse Wishart distribution, the fully conditional posterior distribution of the residual covariance matrix. Finally, a simulated dataset was analysed to illustrate the methodology. This paper concentrates on a model where residuals associated with liabilities of the binary traits are assumed to be independent. A Bayesian analysis using Gibbs sampling is outlined for the model where this assumption is relaxed.},

Moreover, it must be demonstrated that the costs are differential such that negative effects on fitness are more severe for individuals in poor condition than for individuals in good condition. However, in the current literature, there is confusion over what qualifies as a cost, and costs are often anticipated based on findings of increased expenditure. Consequently, it seems that the generally accepted notion that sexual traits are costly is in fact based almost exclusively on indirect evidence and that direct empirical evidence is very scarce.},

In traditional analyses, observed genetic sire effects on offspring phenotype may result from females allocating more resources to the offspring of attractive males. However, maternal effects such as differential allocation may represent a mechanism promoting genetic sire effects, rather than an alternative to them. Here we report results from an experiment on the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, in which we directly compare genetic sire effects with maternal effects that are dependent on sire phenotype. We found strong evidence that mothers provide more resources to offspring when mated with large-horned males. There were significant heritabilities for both horn length and body size, but when differential maternal effects were controlled, the observed estimates of genetic variance were greatly reduced. Our experiment provides evidence that differential maternal effects may amplify genetic effects on offspring traits that are closely related to fitness. Thus, our results may partly explain the relatively high coefficients of additive genetic variation observed in fitness-related traits and provide empirical support for the theoretical argument that maternal effects can play an important role in evolution.},

Cuckolded males did not differ from noncuckolded males with respect to morphology, age, or survival. There was no seasonal pattern in the frequency of extrapair paternity, and males showed no individual consistency in paternity loss over multiple broods. Extrapair offspring did not grow faster, they did not fledge with a higher body mass, and they did not show a higher local survival rate than their half siblings. Hence, there was no evidence of any association between extrapair paternity and male phenotypic or genotypic quality. Extrapair offspring were randomly distributed among broods, with the only exceptions of one blue tit and two great tit broods in which all young (six to nine) were sired by an extrapair male. This pattern is best explained by a small proportion of males (2%-4%) being infertile and by most females performing a few extrapair copulations as insurance against laying infertile eggs. We conclude that the results suggest a role for fertility insurance but that alternative functional explanations to extrapair paternity in these populations cannot yet be ruled out.},

It has been postulated that island populations have a lower frequency of EPP than mainland populations, due to a reduced level of genetic variability. We found an EPP frequency of 5% (of offspring) on the island, and 13% on the mainland, but the difference was not statistically significant. There was neither any difference in genetic variability between the two populations, as assessed by band- sharing analysis of a random subset of breeding individuals. However, band-sharing between Fair mates was significantly higher in the island population, where some individuals seemed to mate with close relatives tone sibling pair was detected), nigh genetic similarity between pair mates on the island did not affect offspring survival, but had a significant negative effect on hatching success. The annual EPP frequency in the two populations was positively correlated with breeding density, but not with breeding synchrony. When the data were analysed on a per nest level, the mainland pl,population showed a tendency of a higher neighbour density (number of conspecific nests within 100 m) fur nests with EPP than for nests without EPP. There was no indication that individual synchrony (the percentage of females in the population that also were fertile when the focal female was fertile) affected the likelihood of EPP. We conclude that there was no particular island effect on the frequency of EPP in our data set. The marginal variation in EPP frequency observed across years and populations is more likely associated with local variations in breeding density and the number of close neighbours.},

We present the results of a comprehensive study in a wild cetacean population to test whether male alliance membership is a prerequisite for reproductive success. We compared two methods for inferring paternity: both calculate a likelihood ratio, called the paternity index, between two opposing hypotheses, but they differ in the way that significance is applied to the data. The first method, a Bayesian approach commonly used in human paternity testing, appeared to be overly conservative for our data set, but would be less susceptible to assumptions if a larger number of microsatellite loci had been used. Using the second approach, the computer program CERVUS 2.0, we successfully assigned 11 paternities to nine males, and 17 paternities to 14 out of 139 sexually mature males at 95% and 80% confidence levels, respectively. It appears that being a member of a bottlenose dolphin alliance is not a prerequisite for paternity: two paternities were obtained by juvenile males (one at the 95%, the other at the 80% confidence level), suggesting that young males without alliance partners pursue different mating tactics to adults. Likelihood analyses showed that these two juvenile males were significantly more likely to be the true father of the offspring than to be their half- sibling (P<0.05). Using paternity data at an 80% confidence level, we could show that reproductive success was significantly skewed within at least some stable first-order alliances (P<0.01). Interestingly, there is powerful evidence that one mating was incestuous, with one calf apparently fathered by its mother's father (P<0.01). Our study suggests that the reproductive success of both allied males, and of nonallied juveniles, needs to be incorporated into an adaptive framework that seeks to explain alliance formation in male bottlenose dolphins.},

We tested three possible explanations for this problem using data on body size of more than 23,000 individuals, measured over 18 yr, in a collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) population. Using a restricted maximum likelihood "animal model," we found a narrow-sense heritability for fledgling tarsus length of S0.35 +/- 0.02 E and substantial common environment effects (0.30 +/- 0.01 SE). For survival to adulthood hood, the selection differential on tarsus length was 0.18 +/- 0.02 SE. There was, however, no response to this selection over the study period. One explanation for the lack of response might have been that selection was associated with only the environmental (nonheritable) component of phenotype, but we found significant selection on breeding values (the heritable component). There was also no evidence of fluctuating selection pressures or of antagonistic selection between the sexes in selection pressures. Thus, in contrast to earlier investigations in this same population, none of the potential explanations for the absence of a selection response was supported; we discuss alternative hypotheses yet to be investigated.},

Inbreeding was rare, to the extent that we detected only 1.04% of 2139 matings over 18 years that resulted in offspring with a non-zero inbreeding coefficient, f > 0. When it did occur, inbreeding caused a significant reduction in the egg-hatching rate, in fledgling skeletal size and in post-fledging juvenile survival, with the number of offspring being recruited to the breeding population from a nest of f = 0.25 being reduced by 94% relative to a non-inbred nest. A maximum-likelihood estimate of the number of lethal equivalents per gamete was very high at B = 7.47, indicating a substantial genetic load in this population. There was also a non-significant tendency for inbreeding depression to increase with the strength of selection on a trait. The probability of mating between close relatives (f = 0.25) increased throughout the breeding season, possibly reflecting increased costs of inbreeding avoidance. Our results illustrate how severe inbreeding depression and considerable genetic load may exist in natural populations, but detecting them may require extensive long-term datasets.},

Despite substantial age- and environment-related variation, antler size was also heritable (heritability of antler mass = 0.33 +/- 0.12). However the observed selection did not generate an evolutionary response in antler size over the study period of nearly 30 years, and there was no evidence of a positive genetic correlation between antler size and fitness nor of a positive association between breeding values for antler size and fitness. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a heritable trait under directional selection will not evolve if associations between the measured trait and fitness are determined by environmental covariances: In red deer males, for example, both antler size and success in the fights for mates may be heavily dependent on an individual's nutritional state.},

We found genetic variation for body size at most nestling ages, and for duration of mass increase, but not of tarsus growth. Hence, nestling growth in our study population seems to have the potential to evolve further. Furthermore, significant genotype-environment interactions indicated heritable variation in reaction norms of growth rates and growth periods, i.e. that our study population had a heritable plasticity in the growth response to environmental conditions. The decreasing phenotypic variance with nestling age indicated compensatory growth in all body traits. Furthermore, the period of weight increase was longer for nestlings growing up in enlarged broods, while there was no difference to reduced broods in the period of tarsus growth. At fledging, birds in enlarged broods had shorter tarsi and lower weights than birds in reduced broods, but there was no difference in wing length or body condition between the two experimental groups. The observed flexibility in nestling growth suggests that growing nestlings are able to respond adaptively to food constraint by protecting the growth of ecologically important traits.},

The principal findings are the following. (1) Sexual imprinting reduces the likelihood of novel adaptive traits spreading through a population, except in some circumstances in which there is heterozygote advantage. (2) Asymmetrical mating preferences, acquired through imprinting, can generate sexual selection for traits that impair survival. (3) The conditions under which sexual imprinting will maintain a genetic polymorphism in a population are fairly restricted. (4) Sexual imprinting can act as a barrier to gene flow minimizing the impact of migration and preserving and accentuating genetic differences between populations.

The variation in protein content in plants eaten during growth could probably explain the observed body size differences, sometimes of more than 10%, between different categories of adult geese.

   Pages = {1394-1400},
   Abstract = {In a recent paper, Gromko (1995) showed using computer simulations that pleiotropy and sampling interact to generate variation in correlated response to selection. His simulations demonstrated that different combinations of pleiotropic effects could lead to the same genetic correlation value, yet, as long as the population size and correlation value were large enough, result in significantly different variance of correlated responses after 10 generations of selection. We extended those results using Alan Roberston's ''reparameterization'' of selection processes in finite populations. As for direct selection response, a satisfactory description of the correlated response and its variability can be expressed in terms of Nih, t/N, and NL, where N is the effective population size, i is the selection intensity in standard units, h(2) is the heritability of the selected and correlated traits, t is the number of generations, and L is the length of the chromosome in map units. For a given number of loci, there exits an Nih threshold under which differences between pleiotropic systems will not be detected. For values of Nih above this threshold, the higher Nih is the smaller t/N needs to be for significant differences in correlated responses between pleiotropic systems to be observed. A large number of loci or tight linkage increases the unpredictability of the correlated response, but if Nih is large enough, it does not absolutely prevent significant differences between pleiotropic systems to occur. On the other hand, a small initial allele frequency of the favorable allele would tend to cancel the differences between pleiotropic systems, even for large values of Nih and t/N. Finally, epistasis decreases the overall variability of the correlated response, but generally preserves the difference between pleiotropic systems. Thus, Gromko's conclusions on the unpredictability of correlated response due to variable pleiotropy seem fairly robust, at least in the long term.},

   Abstract = {Outcrossing rates, pollen dispersal and male mating success were assessed in Dicorynia guianensis Amshoff, a neotropical tree endemic to the Guiana shield. All adult trees within a continuous area of 40 ha (n = 157) were mapped, and were genotyped with six microsatellite loci. In addition, progenies were genotyped from 22 mature trees. At the population level, the species was mostly outcrossing (t(m) = 0.89) but there was marked variation among individuals. One tree exhibited mixed mating, confirming earlier results obtained with isozymes that D. guianensis can tolerate selfing. A Bayesian extension of the fractional paternity method was used for paternity analysis, and was compared with the neighbourhood method used widely for forest trees. Both methods indicated that pollen dispersal was only weakly related to distance between trees within the study area, and that the majority (62%) of pollen came from outside the study stand. Using maximum likelihood, male potential population size was estimated to be 1119, corresponding to a neighbourhood size of 560 hectares. Male mating success was, however, related to the diameter of the stem and to flowering intensity assessed visually. The mating behaviour of D. guianensis is a combination of long-distance pollen flow and occasional selfing. The species can still reproduce when it is extremely rare, either by selfing or by dispersing pollen at long distances. These results, together with the observation that male mating success was correlated with the size of the trees, could be implemented in management procedures aiming at regenerating the species.},

For each population, we measured habitat light characteristics and quantified signal design by measuring the spectral and total reflectance and transmittance of the dewlap. We used these data to calculate dewlap detectability using an empirically based model of signal detection probability. We found that populations from mesic and xeric conditions occupy two distinct habitats with respect to light intensity and spectral quality and that dewlap design has diverged between populations in a way that increases signal detectability in each habitat. The major difference in dewlap design was in total reflectance and transmittance, making dewlaps from xeric habitats darker and dewlaps from mesic habitats brighter. Furthermore, dewlap detection decreased significantly when a dewlap from a xeric habitat is detected under the spectral conditions of a mesic habitat. The converse is true for a dewlap from a mesic habitat. We propose that sensory drive has promoted divergence in dewlap design in distinct habitat light conditions, and we discuss the possibility that selection might promote early stages of reproductive isolation as a by-product of selection on dewlap design to distinct habitat light conditions.},

   Journal = {Ecol. Monogr.},
   Volume = {62},
   Number = {1},
   Pages = {67-118},
   Abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade-offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture-recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture-recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework, these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals (e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such effects. This "analysis of variance" philosophy emphasizes the structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness-of-fit tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex-specific parameters, explores a model with time-dependent survival rates, and finally uses a priori information to model survival allowing for an environmental variable. The second uses data on two colonies of the Swift (Apus apus), and shows how interaction terms can be modeled and assessed and how survival and recapture rates sometimes partly counterbalance each other. The third shows complex variation in survival rates across sexes and age classes in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), with a test of density dependence in annual survival rates. The fourth is an example of experimental density manipulation using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). The last example attempts to examine a large and complex data set on the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), where parameters are age specific, survival is a function of an environmental variable, and an age x year interaction term is important. Heterogeneity seems present in this example and cannot be adequately modeled with existing theory. The discussion presents a summary of the paradigm we recommend and details issues in model selection and design, and foreseeable future developments.},

Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw-data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographic coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. These two approaches are compared in the concluding section. A table provides a list of computer programs available for spatial analysis.},

   Abstract = {I draw attention to the need for ecologists to take spatial structure into account more seriously in hypothesis testing. If spatial autocorrelation is ignored, as it usually is, then analyses of ecological patterns in terms of environmental factors can produce very misleading results. This is demonstrated using synthetic but realistic spatial patterns with known spatial properties which are subjected to classical correlation and multiple regression analyses. Correlation between an autocorrelated response variable and each of a set of explanatory variables is strongly biased in favour of those explanatory variables that are highly autocorrelated - the expected magnitude of the correlation coefficient increases with autocorrelation even if the spatial patterns are completely independent. Similarly, multiple regression analysis finds highly autocorrelated explanatory variables "significant" much more frequently than it should. The chances of mistakenly identifying a "significant" slope across an autocorrelated pattern is very high if classical regression is used. Consequently, under these circumstances strongly autocorrelated environmental factors reported in the literature as associated with ecological patterns may not actually be significant. It is likely that these factors wrongly described as important constitute a red-shifted subset of the set of potential explanations, and that more spatially discontinuous factors (those with bluer spectra) are actually relatively more important than their present status suggests. There is much that ecologists can do to improve on this situation. I discuss various approaches to the problem of spatial autocorrelation from the literature and present a randomisation test for the association of two spatial patterns which has advantages over currently available methods.},

   Abstract = {1. Using data on the spatial distribution of the British avifauna, we address three basic questions about the spatial structure of assemblages: (i) Is there a relationship between species richness (alpha diversity) and spatial turnover of species (beta diversity)? (ii) Do high richness locations have fewer species in common with neighbouring areas than low richness locations?, and (iii) Are any such relationships contingent on spatial scale (resolution or quadrat area), and do they reflect the operation of a particular kind of species- area relationship (SAR)? 2. For all measures of spatial turnover, we found a negative relationship with species richness. This held across all scales, with the exception of turnover measured as beta (sim). 3. Higher richness areas were found to have more species in common with neighbouring areas. 4. The logarithmic SAR fitted better than the power SAR overall, and fitted significantly better in areas with low richness and high turnover. 5. Spatial patterns of both turnover and richness vary with scale. The finest scale richness pattern (10 km) and the coarse scale richness pattern (90 km) are statistically unrelated. The same is true of the turnover patterns. 6. With coarsening scale, locations of the most species-rich quadrats move north. This observed sensitivity of richness 'hotspot' location to spatial scale has implications for conservation biology, e.g. the location of a reserve selected on the basis of maximum richness may change considerably with reserve size or scale of analysis. 7. Average turnover measured using indices declined with coarsening scale, but the average number of species gained or lost between neighbouring quadrats was essentially scale invariant at 10-13 species, despite mean richness rising from 80 to 146 species (across an 81-fold area increase). We show that this kind of scale invariance is consistent with the logarithmic SAR.},

Both morphology (cell size) and fitness (measured in competition with the ancestor) evolved rapidly for the first 2000 generations or so after the populations were introduced into the experimental environment, but both were nearly static for the last 5000 generations. Although evolving in identical environments, the replicate populations diverged significantly from one another in both morphology and mean fitness. The divergence in mean fitness was sustained and implies that the populations have approached different fitness peaks of unequal height in the adaptive landscape. Although the experimental time scale and environment were microevolutionary in scope, our experiments were designed to address questions concerning the origin as well as the fate of genetic and phenotypic novelties, the repeatability of adaptation, the diversification of lineages, and thus the causes and consequences of the uniqueness of evolutionary history. In fact, we observed several hallmarks of macroevolutionary dynamics, including periods of rapid evolution and stasis, altered functional relationships between traits, and concordance of anagenetic and cladogenetic trends. Our results support a Wrightian interpretation, in which chance events (mutation and drift) play an important role in adaptive evolution, as do the complex genetic interactions that underlie the structure of organisms.},

   Abstract = {Experimental manipulation of an organism's environment can reveal trade-offs among life-history and physiological traits such as fecundity and energy reserves. Such phenotypic trade- offs have been suggested to reflect evolutionary constraints. We test this idea by asking whether the selection responses of laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster can be predicted from a trade-off between fecundity and starvation resistance revealed by manipulating levels of dietary yeast. Fecundity and starvation resistance vary inversely over levels of dietary yeast: at high yeast levels, females have a high fecundity and low starvation resistance; at low yeast levels, females have a low fecundity and high starvation resistance. We examine the role of this trade-off in two independent sets of populations that have been selected for increased starvation resistance. We find that the joint selection responses of mean fecundity and starvation resistance cannot be predicted from the phenotypic trade-off in either the ancestral or control populations. This result implies that at least some of the genetic variation and covariation on which selection acted originated in physiological pathways not involved in the phenotypic trade-off. We also find that selection has altered the slope of the phenotypic trade-off such that, across yeast levels, the reproductive cost of a unit gain in starvation resistance is less in the starvation-resistant populations than in the controls.},

   Abstract = {Recognition and analysis of spatial autocorrelation has defined a new paradigm in ecology. Attention to spatial pattern can lead to insights that would have been otherwise overlooked, while ignoring space may lead to false conclusions about ecological relationships. We used Gaussian spatial autoregressive models, fit with widely available software, to examine breeding habitat relationships for three common Neotropical migrant songbirds in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, USA. In preliminary models that ignored space, the abundance of all three species was correlated with both local- and landscape-scale habitat variables. These models were then modified to account for broadscale spatial trend (via trend surface analysis) and fine- scale autocorrelation (via an autoregressive spatial covariance matrix). Residuals from ordinary least squares regression models were autocorrelated, indicating that the assumption of independent errors was violated. In contrast, residuals from autoregressive models showed little spatial pattern, suggesting that these models were appropriate. The magnitude of habitat effects tended to decrease, and the relative importance of different habitat variables shifted when we incorporated broadscale and then fine-scale space into the analysis. The degree to which habitat effects changed when space was added to the models was roughly correlated with the amount of spatial structure in the habitat variables. Spatial pattern in the residuals from ordinary least squares models may result from failure to include or adequately measure autocorrelated habitat variables. In addition, contagious processes, such as conspecific attraction, may generate spatial patterns in species abundance that cannot be explained by habitat models. For our study species, spatial patterns in the ordinary least squares residuals suggest that a scale of 500-1000 m would be appropriate for investigating possible contagious processes.},

It should be selectively advantageous to risk more of their future reproductive success by investing heavily in current offspring of high reproductive value but to decrease investment if offspring value is low. If the benefits of mate attractiveness are limited to a particular offspring sex we would instead expect relative investment in male versus female offspring to vary with mate attractiveness, referred to as 'differential sex allocation'. We present strong evidence for differential allocation of parental feeding effort in the wild and show an immediate effect on a component of offspring fitness. By experimentally reducing male UV crown coloration, a trait known to indicate attractiveness and viability in wild-breeding blue tits (Parus caeruleus), we show that females, but not males, reduce parental feeding rates and that this reduces the skeletal growth of offspring. However, differential sex allocation does not occur. We conclude that blue tit females use male UV coloration as an indicator of expected offspring fitness and adjust their investment accordingly.},

   Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has recently gained use as a method of estimating required probability and likelihood functions in pedigree analysis, when exact computation is impractical. However, when a multiallelic locus is involved, irreducibility of the constructed Markov chain, an essential requirement of the MCMC method, may fail. Solutions proposed by several researchers, which do not identify all the noncommunicating sets of genotypic configurations, are inefficient with highly polymorphic loci. This is a particularly serious problem in linkage analysis, because highly polymorphic markers are much more informative and thus are preferred. In the present paper, we describe an algorithm that finds all the noncommunicating classes of genotypic configurations on any pedigree. This leads to a more efficient method of defining an irreducible Markov chain. Examples, including a pedigree from a genetic study of familial Alzheimer disease, are used to illustrate how the algorithm works and how penetrances are modified for specific individuals to ensure irreducibility.},

However, reducibility is a potential problem for genetic pedigree analysis unless the Markov chain is constructed appropriately.

Transitions between communicating classes, which can be found explicitly, are made by using a Metropolis jumping kernel.

   Abstract = {Good parent and differential allocation models predict relationships between degree of sexual ornamentation and parental care, but relatively few studies have tested these models. The northern cardinal, Cardinalis cardinalis, is a sexually dichromatic species in which both sexes are ornamented. Males have red plumage, and females have tan plumage with limited areas of red feathering. Cardinals were used to address the two models and determine whether plumage brightness signals level of parental care by both sexes. Absolute effort in feeding nestlings by males was not correlated with male breast plumage colour, but effort by females was positively correlated with female underwing plumage colour. Absolute feeding effort by females was also inversely related to brightness of the mate's breast colour. As a consequence, the proportion of a pair's total feedings provided by the male was positively correlated with male breast colour. Proportion of total feedings provided by the female was positively correlated with female wing colour. Feeding efforts (both per nest and per nestling) were correlated between mates, but birds did not mate assortatively in relation to colour. These results support the good parent hypothesis, suggesting colour brightness is a signal of parental care. The results also indicate that ornamentation of both members of the pair may be important determinants of relative efforts in provisioning nestlings by parent birds.

   Abstract = {Intergenerational effects occur when an individual's actions affect not only its own survivorship and reproduction but also those of its offspring and possibly later descendants. In the presence of intergenerational effects, short-term and long-term measures of success ( such as the expected numbers of surviving offspring and of farther descendants, respectively) may be in conflict. When such conflicts occur, life-history theory normally takes long-term measures to predict the outcome of selection. This ignores the fact that, because traits change in time - through mutation, sex, and recombination long- term relations disintegrate. We study this issue with numerical simulations and analytical models combining intergenerational effects and evolutionary change. In the models, the parental investment per offspring, as well as the total reproductive effort, stand for investments in future generations. The models show that the rate of evolutionary change determines the level of those investments. Higher rates of mutation and of sexual as opposed to parthenogenetic reproduction favor lower parental investment per offspring and lower total reproductive effort. It follows that the level of investment of ancestors in descendants responds to the genetic relatedness between the generations of the lineage, in a manner unaccounted for by preexisting theory.},

We used a cross-fostering design and measured genetic correlations and components of social selection arising from two parental and two offspring behaviors in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. Genetic correlations were assessed by examining behavior of relatives independent of common social influences. We found positive genetic correlations between all pairs of behaviors, including between parent and offspring behaviors. Patterns of selection were assessed by standardized performance and selection gradients. Parental provisioning had positive effects on offspring performance and fitness, while remaining near the larvae without feeding them had negative effects. Begging had positive effects on offspring performance and fitness, while increased competition among siblings had negative effects. Coadaptations between parenting and offspring behavior appear to be maintained by genetic correlations and functional trade-offs; parents that feed their offspring more also spend more time in the area where they can forage for themselves. Families with high levels of begging have high levels of sibling competition. Integrating information from genetics and selection thus provides a general explanation for why variation persists in seemingly beneficial traits expressed in parent-offspring interactions and illustrates why it is important to measure functionally related suites of behaviors.},

The yearly survival of females aged 2-7 yr was remarkably similar and very high (92- 95%) in all five populations. Survival of adult males varied among species and populations. Survival decreased from 8 yr onward for both sexes in all populations, suggesting that senescence was a common phenomenon. Male survival was lower than female survival, and the gender difference increased with age. The extent of sex differences in survival was related neither to sexual dimorphism in mass nor to the level of polygyny, suggesting that species differences in social behavior, particularly mating system and the level of male-male aggression, may be more important than simply the level of polygyny in explaining sexual differences in survival. Our results underline the advantages of long-term monitoring of marked individuals for the study of evolutionary ecology.},

This new generalized Michaelis-Menten-type equation provides a flexible model for animal growth capable of describing sigmoidal and diminishing returns behavior. The parameters of the nonlinear model are open to biological interpretation and can be used to calculate reliable estimates of growth traits, such as maximum or average postnatal growth rates. To evaluate the new model, the derived equation and standard growth functions such as the Gompertz and Richards were used to fit 83 growth data sets of different animal species (fish, mice, hamsters? rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, broilers, turkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle) with a large range in body size. A comparative study was carried out based on mathematical, statistical, and biological characteristics of the models. The statistical goodness-of-fit achieved with the new model was similar to that of Richards, and both were slightly superior to the Gompertz. The new model differed from the others with respect to some of the estimated growth traits, but there were highly significant correlation coefficients between estimates obtained with the different models, and the ranking of animals based on growth parameters computed with the new function agreed with the rankings computed by the other models. Therefore, the new model, with its variable inflection point, was able to adequately describe growth in a wide variety of animals, to fit a range of data showing sigmoidal growth patterns, and to provide satisfactory estimates of traits for quantifying the growth characteristics of each type of animal.},

Statistical tests are introduced for evaluating the significance of phylogenetic heritability and of correlations between traits, and expressions are given for the standard errors of ancestral mean phenotype estimates.

To quantify differentiation, we used the concept of a song meme, defined as a single syllable or a series of linked syllables capable of being transmitted. The levels of cultural differentiation are higher among the Canaries populations than among the Azorean ones, even though the islands are on average closer to each other geographically. This is likely the result of reduced levels of migration, lower population sizes, and bottlenecks (possibly during the colonization of these populations) in the Canaries; all these factors produce a smaller effective population size and therefore accentuate the effects of differentiation by random drift. Significant levels of among-population differentiation in the Azores, in spite of substantial levels of migration, attest to the differentiating effects of high mutation rates of memes, which allow the accumulation of new mutants in different populations before migration can disperse them throughout the entire region.},

According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection.

   Abstract = {Meta-analyses are subject to bias for many of reasons, including publication bias. Asymmetry in a funnel plot of study size against treatment effect is often used to identify such bias. We compare the performance of three simple methods of testing for bias: the rank correlation method; a simple linear regression of the standardized estimate of treatment effect on the precision of the estimate; and a regression of the treatment effect on sample size. The tests are applied to simulated meta-analyses in the presence and absence of publication bias. Both one-sided and two-sided censoring of studies based on statistical significance was used. The results indicate that none of the tests performs consistently well. Test performance varied With the magnitude of the true treatment effect, distribution of study size and whether a one- or two-tailed significance test was employed. Overall, the power of the tests was low when the number of studies per meta-analysis was close to that often observed in practice. Tests that showed the highest power also had type I error rates higher than the nominal level. Based on the empirical type I error rates, a regression of treatment effect on sample size, weighted by the inverse of the variance of the logit of the pooled proportion (using the marginal total) is the preferred method.

In this paper, we use data from a long term field study of a passerine bird, the long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus), to examine the heritability of the rate at which parents feed offspring. This measure of effort is positively related to offspring survival, is repeatable within individuals, and does not appear to be confounded by environmental effects. Using both parent-offspring regression, and an animal model approach, with a pedigree derived from ringing data, we show that our measure of effort has a significant heritable component.},

We investigated whether European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and blue tits, Parus caeruleus, show general (nonresource based) or context-specific preferences for full-spectrum environments. We found that neither species showed a general preference for UV- present (UV+) over UV-deficient (UV-) environments, when those environments contained no resources (experiment 1). Furthermore, neither species showed a UV+ preference when cages contained food, water and perches (starlings; experiment 2) or food, perches and heterospecifics (blue tits; Hunt et al. 1999. Animal Behaviour, 58, 809-815). However, both species did show highly significant preferences for UV+ conditions when viewing potential mates. Such experiments are necessary before one can conclude that particular wavebands have specific relevance to mate choice. In fact, our results suggest that the importance of particular wavelength compositions do indeed vary with behavioural context. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

The approach advocated for exploring patterns of interaction among traits is based on the statistical notion of conditional independence, incorporated in a technique known as graphical modeling. The use of graphical models is illustrated with an application to a well-known biological dataset of fowl skeletal measurements, previously analyzed by Sewall Wright. A definition of phenotypic modularity is given, based on a notion of mutual information, which provides a consistent criterion for recognizing and delimiting integrated subsets of traits and which can be related to standard models of multivariate selection.},

Double cones possessed a P568 in both the principal and accessory members. A pale droplet with variable absorbance (maximal at about 420 nm) was associated with the principal member whereas the ellipsoid region of the accessory member contained only low concentrations of carotenoid. The effective spectral sensitivities of the different cone classes were calculated from the characteristic combinations of oil droplets and photopigments and corrected for the absorbance of the ocular media. Comparison of these results with the behavioural spectral sensitivity function of Leiothrix lutea suggests that the increment threshold photopic spectral sensitivity of this avian species is mediated by the 4 single cone classes modified by neural opponent mechanisms.},

   Abstract = {Compensatory or catch-up growth (CG) is widely observed following periods of resource deprivation. Because of this commonness, it is generally assumed that compensatory growth is adaptive, but most theory to date has explicitly ignored considerations of fitness. Following a period of deprivation, when resources become plentiful again, individuals may not respond at all and continue on a "normal" trajectory from a smaller size at age, may exhibit faster-than-normal growth immediately following the end of the period, or may adopt a growth strategy that involves faster-than-normal growth at some later time. Compensating individuals may also overtake control individuals who have been growing normally throughout. We hypothesize that the key to understanding CG is that growth leads to the accumulation of damage at the cellular level that is expressed (and thus must be modeled) at the level of the organism. We show that a life-history model incorporating the mortality consequences of both size and damage provides a framework for understanding compensatory growth. We use the theory to classify physiological and life-history characteristics for which CG is predicted to be the optimal response to deprivation.},

In all analyses the additive, maternal genetic, maternal environmental, and residual effects were fitted along with the covariance between direct and maternal additive effects. The contributions of particular genetic relationships to the estimates were studied by analyzing subsets of the SSRS data. A further eight subsets were formed having 10% or 50% of the dams with their own records and having one or two, three or four, five or six, and more than six offspring per dam. Analysis of data having only 10% of the dams with their own record and one or two offspring records yielded a high negative correlation (-0.99) between direct and maternal genetic effects. However, the seven other data sets with more records per dam or a higher proportion of dams with their own records produced values of -0.35 to -0.51. Data structure and the number of dams and granddams with records are important determinants of estimated direct and maternal effects in early growth traits.},

Factors influencing the evolution of signals used in communication include the properties of the physical environment in which the signal is generated2-10, the perceptual systems of individuals (such as potential mates or predators) receiving the signal2,3,11-16, and the nature of the information signalled. In warblers of the genus Phylloscopus, species differences in colour patterns are correlated with light intensity of the habitat: brighter species live in darker habitats. I report here two observations that colour patterns function to increase conspicuousness, and are used in intraspecific communication. First, individuals make themselves temporarily more conspicuous by flashing the bright colour patterns in display, and are less conspicuous when not displaying. Second, experimentally increasing conspicuousness of males within a given habitat increases territory size, whereas experimentally reducing conspicuousness results in either a smaller territory or its total loss. Traits used in intraspecific communication are often thought to diverge as a result of variation in perceptual systems2,3,13,15-17. This study shows that variation in the physical environment can cause species divergence, and this will occur whether perceptual systems are variable or relatively constant.},

   Abstract = {Similarity of genetic and phenotypic variation patterns among populations is important for making quantitative inferences about past evolutionary forces acting to differentiate populations and for evaluating the evolution of relationships among traits in response to new functional and developmental relationships. Here, phenotypic covariance and correlation structure is compared among Platyrrhine Neotropical primates. Comparisons range from among species within a genus to the superfamily level. Matrix correlation followed by Mantel's test and vector correlation among responses to random natural selection vectors (random skewers) were used to compare correlation and variance/covariance matrices of 39 skull traits. Sampling errors involved in matrix estimates were taken into account in comparisons using matrix repeatability to set upper limits for each pairwise comparison. Results indicate that covariance structure is not strictly constant but that the amount of variance pattern divergence observed among taxa is generally low and not associated with taxonomic distance. Specific instances of divergence are identified. There is no correlation between the amount of divergence in covariance patterns among the 16 genera and their phylogenetic distance derived from a conjoint analysis of four already published nuclear gene datasets. In contrast, there is a significant correlation between phylogenetic distance and morphological distance (Mahalanobis distance among genus centroids). This result indicates that while the phenotypic means were evolving during the last 30 millions years of New World monkey evolution, phenotypic covariance structures of Neotropical primate skulls have remained relatively consistent. Neotropical primates can be divided into four major groups based on their feeding habits (fruit-leaves, seed-fruits, insect-fruits, and gum-insect-fruits). Differences in phenotypic covariance structure are correlated with differences in feeding habits, indicating that to some extent changes in interrelationships among skull traits are associated with changes in feeding habits. Finally, common patterns and levels of morphological integration are found among Platyrrhine primates. suggesting that functional/developmental integration could be one major factor keeping covariance structure relatively stable during evolutionary diversification of South American monkeys.},

   Abstract = {A central controversy among biologists is the relative importance of natural selection and genetic drift as creative forces shaping biological diversification ( Fisher 1930; Wright 1931). Historically, this controversy has been an effective engine powering several evolutionary research programs during the last century (Provine 1989). While all biologists agree that both processes operate in nature to produce evolutionary change, there is a diversity of opinion about which process dominates at any particular organizational level ( from DNA and proteins to complex morphologies). To address this last level, we did a broadscale analysis of cranial diversification among all living New World monkeys. Quantitative genetic models yield specific predictions about the relationship between variation patterns within and between populations that may be used to test the hypothesis that genetic drift is a sufficient explanation for morphological diversification. Diversity at several levels in a hierarchy of taxonomic/ phylogenetics relationship was examined from species within genera to families within superfamilies. The major conclusion is that genetic drift can be ruled out as the primary source of evolutionary diversification in cranial morphology among taxa at the level of the genus and above as well as for diversification of most genera. However, drift may account for diversification among species within some Neotropical primate genera, implying that morphological diversification associated with speciation need not be adaptive in some radiations.},

   Abstract = {Paternity inference using highly polymorphic codominant markers is becoming common in the study of natural populations. However, multiple males are often found to be genetically compatible with each offspring tested, even when the probability of excluding an unrelated male is high. While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic Delta for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for Delta that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence. The simulation takes account of the number of candidate males, the proportion of males that are sampled and gaps and errors in genetic data. We explore the potentially confounding effect of relatives and show that the method is robust to their presence under commonly encountered conditions. The method is demonstrated using genetic data from the intensively studied led deer (Cervus elaphus) population on the island of Rum, Scotland. The Windows-based computer program, CERVUS dagger, described in this study is available from the authors. CERVUS can be used to calculate allele frequencies, run simulations and perform parentage analysis using data from all types of codominant markers.},

In Eurasia body size decreases clinally from north- northeast to south-southwest, and bill thinness and relative tarsal length increase clinally from the northeast to the southwest. This variation is consistent with changes in environmental factors known to affect these characters. Geographical isolates in North Africa vary in size and in bill and tarsus morphology in a way consistent with habitat variation among isolates. Similarities in mensural characters among samples are more consistent with similarities in ecological conditions than with taxonomy. Geographical variation in plumage pattern essentially is clinal in Eurasia but discontinuous in North Africa. On a broad scale, plumage pattern variation is consistent with the population groups defined by taxonomists (Eurasian and North African population groups). Within each population group consistency between variation in plumage pattern and the probable population phylogeny is poor. My results substantiate the importance of the unifying effect of gene flow in adjacent samples even over a large geographical area and the necessity of geographical isolation to foster the appearance of gaps in clinal variation or of markedly different population characteristics.},

   Abstract = {Brownian motion computer simulation was used to test the statistical properties of a spatial autoregressive method in estimating evolutionary correlations between two traits using interspecific comparative data. When applied with a phylogeny of 42 species, the method exhibited reasonable Type I and II error rates. Estimation abilities were comparable to those of independent contrasts and minimum evolution (parsimony) methods, and generally superior to a traditional nonphylogenetic approach (not taking phylogenies into account at all). However, the autoregressive method performed extremely poorly with a smaller phylogeny (15 species) and with nearly independent (''star'') phylogenies. In both of these situations, any phylogenetic autocorrelation present in the data was not detected by the method. Results show how diagnostic techniques (e.g., Moran's I) can be useful in detecting and avoiding such situations, but that such techniques should not be used as definitive evidence that phylogenetic correlation is not present in a set of comparative data. The correction factor (a) proposed by Gittleman and Kot (1990) for use in weighting phylogenetic information had little effect in most analyses of 15 or 42 species with incorrect phylogenetic information, and may require much larger sample sizes before significant improvement is shown. With the sample sizes tested in this study, however, the autoregressive method implemented with this correction factor and correct phylogenetic information led to downwardly biased estimates of the absolute magnitude of the evolutionary correlation between two traits. Cautions and recommendations for implemention of the spatial autoregressive method are given; computer programs to conduct the analyses are available on request.},

A generalized Linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose novel ways of incorporating within-species variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of considering both continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative or ''state'') characters in the same analysis.},

   Abstract = {The diversity of body sizes of organisms has traditionally been explained in terms of microevolutionary processes: natural selection owing to differential fitness of individual organisms, or to macroevolutionary processes: species selection owing to the differential proliferation of phylogenetic lineages. Data for terrestrial mammals and birds indicate that even on a logarithmic scale frequency distributions of body mass among species are significantly skewed towards larger sizes. We used simulation models to evaluate the extent to which macro- and microevolutionary processes are sufficient to explain these distributions. Simulations of a purely cladogenetic process with no bias in extinction or speciation rates for different body sizes did not produce skewed log body mass distributions. Simulations that included size-biased extinction rates, especially those that incorporated anagenetic size change within species between speciation and extinction events, regularly produced skewed distributions. We conclude that although cladogenetic processes probably play a significant role in body size evolution, there must also be a significant anagenetic component. The regular variation in the form of mammalian body size distributions among different-sized islands and continents suggests that environmental conditions, operating through both macro- and microevolutionary processes, determine to a large extent the diversification of body sizes within faunas. Macroevolution is not decoupled from microevolution.},

However, for many organisms the degree to which sexual dichromatism occurs has been determined within the confines of human perception. For birds, objective measures of plumage color have revealed previously unappreciated sexual dichromatism for several species. Here we present an unbiased assessment of plumage dichromatism in the yellow-breasted chat Icteria virens. Chats exhibit yellow to orange throat and breast plumage that to the unaided human observer differs only subtly in color. Spectrophotometric analyses revealed that chat throat and breast feathers exhibited reflective curves with two peaks, one in the ultraviolet and one in the yellow end of the spectrum. We found differences in both the shape and magnitude of reflectance curves between males and females. Moreover, for feathers collected from the lower edge and middle of the breast patch, male plumage reflected more light in the ultraviolet and yellow wavelengths compared to females, whereas male throat feathers appeared brighter than those of females only in the ultraviolet. Biochemical analyses indicated that the plumage pigmentation consisted solely of the carotenoid all-trans lutein and we found that males have higher concentrations of plumage carotenoids than females. Feathers that were naturally unpigmented reflected more UV light than yellow feathers, suggesting a potential role of feather microstructure in UV reflectance.},

Juvenile growth in both body mass and size had significant amounts of genetic variation (mass h(2)=0.10; size h(2)=0.33), but experienced large, heritable maternal effects. Growth in body mass also had a large positive covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects. The consideration of these indirect genetic effects revealed a greater than three-fold increase in the potential for evolution of growth in body mass (h(t)(2)=0.36) relative to that predicted by heritability alone. Simple heritabilities, therefore, may severely underestimate or overestimate the potential for evolution in natural populations of animals.},

Directional selection on nestling growth rates varied in magnitude and direction from one cohort to the next. The magnitude of directional selection was relatively weak in most years (median beta' = 0.24). but there were episodes of very strong viability selection (beta' > 0.5) in some cohorts. We found no evidence of significant stabilizing or disruptive selection on this trait. Examination of viability selection episodes over shorter time periods suggested that the strength of selection on juveniles in this population was positively related to the time scale over which selection was measured. Viability selection from birth to emergence from the natal nest (50 days of age) and from emergence to successful recruitment (100 days of age) were positively correlated, but were both independent of selection on nestling growth rates from recruitment to potential breeding age (one year). The strength of directional selection on growth rates prior to recruitment was negatively correlated with spring temperature whereas selection from recruitment to breeding was positively correlated with the abundance of spruce cones produced in the previous fall. Episodes of strong directional selection from birth to breeding age appear to be due to potentially rare combinations of environmental conditions. As a result, predicting the occurrence of very strong episodes of selection will be extremely difficult, but predicting the microevolutionary responses to observed selection on individual cohorts remains feasible.},

Second, responses to selection were influenced not only by the strength of selection in the current generation, but also by selection in the previous generation, indicating the presence of evolutionary momentum.

One possibility is that ornamental traits convey different sets of information about the quality of the sender to the receiver.

Evidence suggests that carotenoid pigmentation reflects the nutritional condition of males during moult, whereas in many instances melanin pigmentation is a reliable indicator of social status. However, as of yet there have been no experimental tests to determine how these two ornament types respond to the same form of environmental stress. In this study we tested the effect of endoparasitic infection by intestinal coccidians (Isospora sp.) on tho expression of both carotenoid- and melanin-based ornamental coloration in captive male American goldfinches (Carduelis tristis). We found that the carotenoid-based plumage and bill coloration of parasitized males was less saturated than that developed by unparasitized males, but that the brightness and size of melanin-based black caps did not differ between the groups. These findings provide the most robust empirical support to date for the notion that carotenoid and melanin ornaments reveal different information to conspecifics.},

However. few studies have considered experimentally how the availability of carotenoid pigments in the diet influences variability in the expression of carotenoid-based coloration. 3. Dietary access to carotenoids was manipulated in captive groups of male American Goldfinches (Carduelis tristis L.) and Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis L.) to assess the role of pigment acquisition in shaping intraspecific variation in carotenoid- based plumage pigmentation. 4. Substantial variation was detected in the plumage displays of captive male goldfinches and cardinals within a diet treatment. such that birds with unlimited access to the same diet type displayed carotenoid- based plumage variation that did not differ significantly from that typical of wild males from each species. Additionally, the natural plumage brightness that male goldfinches displayed at capture predicted the degree to which they grew colourful plumage under controlled conditions in our experiments. 5. These results suggest that carotenoid-based plumage variation in male goldfinches and cardinals is less sensitive to pigment availability in the diet than colour variation observed in other studied taxa. Differences in ornamental coloration among males from these two passerine species may instead reflect their ability to utilize ingested pigments physiologically.},

HPLC analyses of feather pigments revealed that male finches incorporated a higher concentration of carotenoids into their pigmented feathers than females. Compared to females, males also deposited significantly more canary xanthophyll B into feathers when fed a plain-seed diet and a greater concentration and proportion of canthaxanthin when fed a carotenoid-supplemented diet.

In many species, the brightness of carotenoid-based plumage reflects the health and condition of individuals and is used in mate selection. The information contained in melanin-based and structurally based ornamental colors in birds is less well resolved, however. We subjected male house sparrows Passer domesticus and brown- headed cowbirds Molothrus ater to stressful nutritional conditions during molt to test the hypothesis that melanin- and structurally based plumage colors are nutritionally condition- dependent. We restricted food access for treatment males during randomized 6h periods on 4 days per week, while allowing control birds access to food ad libitum throughout the course of the molt. We found that the size and brightness of the melanin-based throat badges in male house sparrows were not affected by nutritional stress. Similarly, there were no differences between treatment and control male cowbirds in the size or brightness of the melanin-based brown hood. However, the structurally based iridescent plumage of cowbirds was indicative of the nutritional condition of males during molt. Nutritionally stressed cowbirds grew significantly less colorful plumage than did males with access to food ad libitum. These results are consistent with observations in other avian species that different types of plumage color communicate different sets of information. Melanin ornaments are less sensitive to nutritional conditions during molt and instead may reflect the hormonal status and/or competitive ability of males, whereas structural coloration appears to be an accurate signal of health and condition.},

The direct means by which the most colorful males achieve superior health has been debated, however. One hypothesis, based on studies of carotenoids as antioxidants in humans and other animals, is that carotenoids directly boost the immune system of colorful birds. We studied the relationship between carotenoid pigments, immune function, and sexual coloration in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species in which males incorporate carotenoid pigments into their beak to attract mates. We tested the hypotheses that increased dietary carotenoid intake enhances immunocompetence in male zebra finches and that levels of carotenoids circulating in blood, which also determine beak coloration, directly predict the immune response of individuals. We experimentally supplemented captive finches with two common dietary carotenoid pigments (lutein and zeaxanthin) and measured cell-mediated and humoral immunity a month later. Supplemented males showed elevated blood-carotenoid levels, brighter beak coloration, and increased cell-mediated and humoral immune responses than did controls. Cell-mediated responses were predicted directly by changes in beak color and plasma carotenoid concentration of individual birds. These experimental findings suggest that carotenoid-based color signals in birds may directly signal male health via the immunostimulatory action of ingested and circulated carotenoid pigments.},

In particular, the relative contributions of dietary and physiological mechanisms have been questioned of late. However, no studies have concurrently quantified levels of food intake or pigment processing in any species to examine the comparative effects of pigment acquisition and use on integumetary coloration. Here, we studied within- and between-sex patterns of food intake and plasma pigment circulation in the Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to assess how sexually dichromatic, carotenoid-based bill pigmentation serves as an indicator of pigment access in the diet and carotenoid transport through the bloodstream. First, in a food-choice study, we found that males and females did not consume different types or amounts of food, despite dramatic sex differences in bill coloration. Similarly, variability in carotenoid-based bill pigmentation within each sex was uncoupled from levels of food consumption. Next, we used high-performance liquid-chromatography (HPLC) to quantify the types and amounts of carotenoids circulating through blood. Male and female Zebra Finches circulated the same four major carotenoid pigments in blood plasma (lutein, zeaxanthin, anhydrolutein, and beta-cryptoxanthin), but males circulated a significantly higher concentration of plasma carotenoids than did females. Within both sexes, individuals that circulated more carotenoid pigments displayed more brightly colored bills. In sum, these results suggest that physiological factors such as pigment transport may play a more important role in shaping variability in carotenoid-based bill coloration in this species than does diet. Future studies should be aimed at identifying the proximate determinants of plasma carotenoid circulation in these birds as well as how circulated pigments are used to produce maximum color displays.},

We examined the carotenoid profiles of three New World passerines that display yellow plumage coloration- the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and evening grosbeak (Coccothraustes vespertinus). Using high- performance liquid chromatography, we found that all species used only one carotenoid-lutein- to color their plumage yellow. Analyses of blood carotenoids (which document those pigments taken up from the diet) in two of the species, however, revealed the presence of two dietary xanthophylls-lutein and zeaxanthin-that commonly co-occur in plants and animals. These findings demonstrate post-absorptive selectivity of carotenoid deposition in bird feathers. To learn more about the site of pigment discrimination, we also analyzed the carotenoid composition of lipid fractions from the follicles of immature yellow-pigmented feathers in G. trichas and D. petechia and again detected both lutein and zeaxanthin.

   Abstract = {Many animals develop bright red, orange, or yellow carotenoid pigmentation that they use to attract mates. Colorful carotenoid pigments are acquired from the diet and are either directly incorporated as integumentary colorants or metabolized into other forms before deposition. Because animals often obtain several different carotenoids from plant and animal food sources, it is possible that these pigments are accumulated at different levels in the body and may play unique roles in shaping the ultimate color expression of individuals. We studied patterns of carotenoid accumulation and integumentary pigmentation in two colorful finch species - the American goldfinch (Carduelis tristis) and the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Both species acquire two main hydroxycarotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, from their seed diet but transform these into a series of metabolites that are used as colorful pigments in the plumage ( goldfinches only) and beak ( both species). We conducted a series of carotenoid-supplementation experiments to investigate the relative extent to which lutein and zeaxanthin are accumulated in blood and increase carotenoid coloration in feathers and bare parts. First, we supplemented the diets of both species with either lutein or zeaxanthin and measured plasma pigment status, feather carotenoid concentration ( goldfinches only), and integumentary color. Zeaxanthin- supplemented males grew more colorful feathers and beaks than lutein-supplemented males, and in goldfinches incorporated a different ratio of carotenoids in feathers (favoring the accumulation of canary xanthophyll B). We also fed goldfinches different concentrations of a standard lutein-zeaxanthin mix and found that at physiologically normal and high concentrations, birds circulated proportionally more zeaxanthin over lutein than occurred in the diet. Collectively, these results demonstrate that zeaxanthin is preferentially accumulated in the body and serves as a more potent substrate for pigmentation than lutein in these finches.},

We examined replicate natural populations of the rainbow fishes Melanotaenia eachamensis and M. duboulayi to determine if colonization of low-velocity (lake) habitats by fish from high- velocity (stream) habitats resulted in adaptation of locomotor morphology and performance. Relative to stream conspecifics, lake fish had more posteriorly positioned first dorsal and pelvic fins, and shorter second dorsal fin bases. Habitat dimorphism observed between wild-caught fish was determined to be heritable as it was retained in M. eachamensis offspring raised in a common garden. Repeated evolution of the same heritable phenotype in independently derived populations indicated body shape divergence was a consequence of natural selection. Morphological divergence between hydrological habitats did not support a priori expectations of deeper bodies and caudal peduncles in lake fish. However, observed divergence in fin positioning was consistent with a family-wide association between habitat and morphology, and with empirical studies on other fish species. As predicted, decreased demand for sustained swimming in takes resulted in a reduction in caudal red muscle area of lake fish relative to their stream counterparts. Melanotaenia duboulayi lake fish also had slower sustained swimming speeds (U-crit) than stream conspecifics. In M. eachamensis, habitat affected U-crit of males and females differently. Specifically, females exhibited the pattern observed in M. duboulayi (lake fish had faster U-crit than stream fish), but the opposite association was observed in males (stream males had slower Ucrit than lake males). Stream M. eachamensis also exhibited a reversed pattern of sexual dimorphism in U-crit (males slower than females) relative to all other groups (males faster than females). We suggest that M. eachamensis males from streams responded to factors other than water velocity. Although replication of muscle and U,,it phenotypes across same habitat populations within and/or among species was suggestive of adaptation, the common garden experiment did not confirm a genetic basis to these associations. Kinematic studies should consider the effect of the position and base length of dorsal fins.},

Is this replicated evolution a result of genetic constraints imposed by patterns of genetic covariation? We looked for associations between directions of morphological divergence and the orientation of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) by using an experimental system of morphological evolution in two allopatric nonsister species of rainbow fish. Replicate populations of both Melanotaenia eachamensis and Melanotaenia duboulayi have independently adapted to lake versus stream hydrodynamic environments. The major axis of divergence (z) among all eight study populations was closely associated with the direction of greatest genetic variance (g(max)), suggesting directional genetic constraint on evolution. However, the direction of hydrodynamic adaptation was strongly associated with vectors of G describing relatively small proportions of the total genetic variance, and was only weakly associated with g(max). In contrast, divergence between replicate populations within each habitat was approximately proportional to the level of genetic variance, a result consistent with theoretical predictions for neutral phenotypic divergence. Divergence between the two species was also primarily along major eigenvectors of G. Our results therefore suggest that hydrodynamic adaptation in rainbow fish was not directionally constrained by the dominant eigenvector of G. Without partitioning divergence as a consequence of the adaptation of interest (here, hydrodynamic adaptation) from divergence due to other processes, empirical studies are likely to overestimate the potential for the major eigenvectors of G to directionally constrain adaptive evolution.},

   Abstract = {The traditional explanation for interspecific plumage colour variation in birds is that colour differences between species are adaptations to minimize the risk of hybridization. Under this explanation, colour differences between closely related species of birds represent reproductive character displacement. An alternative explanation is that interspecific variation in plumage colour is an adaptive response to variation in light environments across habitats. Under this explanation, differences in colour between closely related species are a product of selection on signal efficiency. We use a comparative approach to examine these two hypotheses, testing the effects of sympatry and habitat use, respectively, on divergence in male plumage colour. Contrary to the prediction of the Species Isolation Hypothesis, we find no evidence that sympatric pairs of species are consistently more divergent in coloration than are allopatric pairs of species. However, in agreement with the Light Environment Hypothesis, we find significant associations between plumage coloration and habitat use. All of these results remain qualitatively unchanged irrespective of the statistical methodology used to compare reflectance spectra, the body regions used in the analyses, or the exclusion of areas of plumage not used in sexual displays. Our results suggest that, in general, interspecific variation in plumage colour among birds is more strongly influenced by the signalling environment than by the risk of hybridization.},

   Abstract = {Modeling of R.A. Fisher's ideas about the evolution of male ornamentation using quantitative genetics began in the 1980s. Following an initial period of enthusiasm, interest in these models began to wane when theoretical studies seemed to show that the rapid evolution of ornaments would not occur if there were costs associated with female mate choice. Recent theoretical work has shown, however, that runaway evolution and other kinds of extensive diversification of ornaments and preferences can occur, even when female choice is costly. These new models highlight crucial parameters that profoundly influence evolutionary trajectories, but these parameters have been neglected in empirical studies. Here, we review quantitative genetic models of sexual selection with the aim of fostering communication and synergism between theoretical and empirical enterprises. We also point out several areas in which additional empirical work could distinguish between alternative models of evolution.},

However, the importance of variation in achromatic plumage colors (white, gray and black) remains virtually unexplored, despite their widespread occurrence. We investigated a potential signal function of the achromatic black and white plumage of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla). We captured and color-banded 178 free-living chickadees and assessed winter flock dominance hierarchies by tabulating pairwise interactions at feeders. We recaptured 73 of these birds and measured plumage coloration for six body regions using a reflectance spectrometer and the area of melanin-based plumage patches from standardized photographs. We found extensive individual variation in chickadee plumage traits and considerable sexual dichromatism. Male black-capped chickadees have significantly brighter white plumage than females, larger black patches, and greater plumage contrast between adjacent white and black plumage regions. We also found rank differences in the plumage reflectance of males; high-ranking males, who are preferred by females as both social and extra-pair partners, exhibit significantly darker black plumage and grow their feathers more rapidly than low-ranking males. This variation among individuals reveals a potential signal function for achromatic plumage coloration in birds.},

   Abstract = {Four external skeletal and three feather dimensions were measured on adult collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) and their adult offspring. By using mid-offspring-midparent regressions, all traits were found to be heritable with an arithmetic mean heritability of 0.46. Heritability estimates from full-sib analyses were about 1.5 times higher (mean 0.67), indicating that variation in traits was affected by shared nest environment among full-sibs. The overall body size as measured by principal component one (PC1) was found to be heritable (h2 = 0.40). However, this multivariate measure of heritability was not significant in offspring-father comparison, while highly so in offspring-mother comparison (h2 = 0.60). Low offspring- father resemblance was evident also in univariate estimates of heritability. Possible causes of this (extra-pair copulations, maternal effects, sex-linked variance) are discussed. Genetic correlations among seven traits were estimated to be low (mean 0.22), and of similar magnitude or higher than phenotypic correlations (mean 0.18). All genetic correlations were positive. Genetic and phenotypic correlations as well as covariances were fairly similar to each other (r = 0.85 and r = 0.87, respectively). Environmental correlations did not follow the pattern of genetic correlations (r = 0.11), but were more similar to phenotypic correlations (r = 0.60). Given the low genetic correlations and moderate heritabilities, the overall conclusion is that the external morphology of collared flycatchers is largely under additive genetic control and that there is a strong potential for evolutionary change in morphology even under complex multivariate selection.},

Offspring quality, measured as nestling body mass at day 13 post-hatch, declined significantly with increasing brood size, as did offspring structural body size (tarsus length). A quantitative genetic analysis revealed a high heritability of tarsus length, but also that the shorter tarsi of young from larger broods represented a negative environmental deviation from the genotypic values of their parents. Similarly, positive environmental deviations in tarsus length were found in small broods. Nestling mortality increased with increasing brood size, and smaller and lighter nestlings suffered higher mortality between day 13 and 20 post-hatch. These findings, together with those of previous studies showing that the survival prospects of malnutritioned passerine young are greatly reduced, provide evidence for a trade-off between the quantity and quality of young under non-manipulative conditions.},

   Abstract = {Heritability of body size in two experimentally created environments, representing good and poor feeding conditions, respectively, was estimated using cross-fostered collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis nestlings. Young raised under poor feeding conditions attained smaller body size (tarsus length) than their full-sibs raised under good feeding conditions. Parent-offspring regressions revealed lower heritability (h(2)) of body size under poor than under good feeding conditions. Hence, as the same set of parents were used in the estimation of h(2) in both environments, this suggests environment-dependent change in additive genetic component of variance (Va), or that the genetic correlation between parental and poor offspring environment was less than that between parental and good offspring environment. However, full-sib analyses failed to find evidence for genotype-environment interactions, although the power of these rests might have been low. Full-sib heritabilities in both environments tended to be higher than estimates from parent-offspring regressions, indicating that prehatching or early posthatching common environment/maternal effects might have inflated full-sib estimates of V-A. The effect of sibling competition on estimates of V-A was probably small as the nestling size- hierarchy at day 2 posthatch was not generally correlated with size-hierarchy al fledging. Furthermore, there was no correlation between maternal body condition during the incubation and final size of offspring, indicating that direct maternal effects related to nutritional status were small. A review of earlier quantitative genetic studies of body size variation in birds revealed that in eight of nine cases, heritability of body size was lower in poor than in good environmental conditions. The main implication of this relationship will be a decreased evolutionary response to selection under poor environmental conditions. On the other hand, this will retard the loss of genetic variation by reducing the accuracy of selection and might help explain the moderate ro high heritabilities of body-size traits under good environmental conditions.},

Antagonistic selection of this kind may be an important mechanism by which additive genetic variation for quantitative traits is maintained, and can prevent populations or species reaching local adaptive peaks. This paper reports the results of a study of viability selection on morphological traits of nestling collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis. Analyses performed without knowledge of the sex of nestlings suggested that no selection was occurring on these traits. However, using molecular sex identification with the avian CHD gene, it is shown that selection acts in different directions on male and female body size from fledging to breeding, apparently favouring relatively small males and large females. The results suggest that differential selection on male and female nestlings may contribute to purely phenotypic sexual size dimorphism in this species. These findings highlight the potential of newly developed molecular sexing techniques to reveal the consequences of an individual's gender for many aspects of its life history in taxa where gender cannot be determined on the basis of external appearance.},

This has led to the suggestion that adaptation under poor regimens may be constrained by lack of genetic variation. We examined the influence of environmental conditions on expression of genetic variation in body size of nestling blue tits (Parus caeruleus) by raising full sibs in artificially reduced and enlarged broods, corresponding to good and poor feeding regimens, respectively. Individuals grown in the poor regimen attained smaller body size than their sibs grown in the good regimen. However, there was among-family variation in response to the treatments-i.e., genotype environment interactions (GEIs). Partitioning the GEI variance into contributions attributable to (1) differences in the among- family genetic variance between the treatments and (2) imperfect correlation of genotypic values across treatments identified the latter as the main cause of the GEI. Parent- offspring I-egressions were not significantly different when offspring were reared in the good environment (h(2) = 0.75) vs. when they were reared in the poor environment (h(2) = 0.63). Thus, there was little evidence that genetic variance in body size was lower under the poor conditions than under the good conditions. These results do not support the view that the genetic potential for adaptation to poor feeding conditions is less than that for adaptation to good conditions, but they do suggest that different genotypes may be favored under the different conditions.},

   Abstract = {Quantitative genetic theory predicts that evolution of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) will be a slow process if the genetic correlation in size between the sexes is close to unity, and the heritability of size is similar in both sexes. However, there are very few reliable estimates of genetic correlations and sex-specific heritabilities from natural populations, the reasons for this being that (1) offspring have often been sexed retrospectively, and hence, selection acting differently with respect to body size in the two sexes between measuring and sex identification can bias estimates of SSD, and (2) in many taxa, parents may be incorrectly assigned to offspring either because of assignment errors or because of extrapair paternity. We used molecular sex and paternity identification to overcome these problems and estimated sex-specific heritabilities and the genetic correlation in body size between the two sexes in the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. After exclusion of the illegitimate offspring, the genetic correlation in body size between the sexes was 1.00 (SE = 0.22), implying a severe constraint on the evolution of SSD in this species. Furthermore, sex-specific heritability estimates were very similar, indicating that neither sex will be able to evolve faster than the other. By using estimated genetic parameters, together with empirically derived estimates of sex-specific selection gradients, we further demonstrated that the predicted selection response in female tarsus length is displaced about 200% in the opposite direction from that to be expected if there were no genetic correlation between the sexes. The correspondence between the biochemically estimated rate of extrapair paternity (about 15% of the young) and that estimated from the "heritability method" (11%) was good. However, the estimated rate of extrapair paternity with the heritability method after exclusion of the illegitimate young was 22%, adding to increasing evidence that factors other than extrapair paternity (e.g., maternal effects) may be resposible for the commonly observed higher mother-offspring than father-offspring resemblance.},

   Abstract = {Theory predicts that genetic and phenotypic correlations among traits may direct the process of short-term evolution by limiting the directions of variation available to natural selection to act on. We studied correlations between 14 skeletal traits in 10 geographically distinct and relatively young greenfinch (Carduelis chloris) populations to unravel whether the divergence among populations has occurred into directions predicted by the within-population correlations (cf. drift/correlated responses models), or whether it is better explained by 'adaptive' models, which predict no necessary association between within- and among-population correlations (allometries). We found that the within-population character correlations (or covariances) did not predict character divergence between populations. This was because the first eigenvector of the among-population correlation/covariance matrix, summarizing the major dimension of divergence, was a bipolar body:beak dimension, and distinct from the (approximate to isometric) first eigenvector of within-population matrix. Hence, as the divergence among greenfinch populations cannot be satisfactorily accommodated by drift/correlated response models, an adaptive basis for divergence is suggested. The second major axis of within-population variation was a classical 'group size' factor revealing that beak size was more or less free to vary independently of body size. Consequently, even if the divergence among populations cannot be simply accommodated to expectations of drift and correlated response models, it is striking that the most pronounced size- independent (nonallometric) changes had occurred along the second largest dimension of variance. This could mean that selection pressures which shape integration within populations are the same as those that cause divergence among populations. A relaxed beak:body integration could also occur as a result of species level selection favouring taxa in which independent evolution of beak and body is made possible.},

In three different study years, nestlings grown under a poor feeding regime attained lower body condition than their full-sibs grown under a good feeding regime. Genetic influences on condition were large and significant in both feeding regimes, and in all three study years. However, although estimates of additive genetic variance were consistently higher in the poor than in the good environment, heritability estimates for body condition index were very similar in both environments due to higher levels of environmental variance in the poor environment. Evidence for weak genotype x environment interactions was obtained, but these contributed little to variance in nestling condition. Directional natural selection on fledging condition of nestlings was detected, and there were no indications of year or environmental effects on the form and intensity of selection observed, in a sample of 3659 nestlings over four years. However, selection on hedging condition was very weak (standardized selection gradient, beta = 0.027 +/- 0.016 SE), suggesting that, in the current population, the large additive genetic component to fledging condition is not particularly surprising.

   Abstract = {Comparative studies of the genetic architecture of different types of traits were initially prompted by the expectation that traits under strong directional selection (fitness traits) should have lower levels of genetic variability than those mainly under weak stabilizing selection (nonfitness traits). Hence, early comparative studies revealing lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits were first framed in terms of giving empirical support for this prediction, but subsequent treatments have effectively reversed this view. Fitness traits seem to have higher levels of additive genetic variance than nonfitness traits - an observation that has been explained in terms of the larger number loci influencing fitness as compared to nonfitness traits. This hypothesis about the larger functional architecture of fitness than nonfitness traits is supported by their higher mutational variability, which is hard to reconcile without evoking capture of mutational variability over many loci. The lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits, despite the higher additive genetic variance of the former, occur because of their higher residual variances. Recent comparative studies of dominance contributions for different types of traits, together with theoretical predictions and a large body of indirect evidence, suggest an important role of dominance variance in determining levels of residual variance for fitness-traits. The role of epistasis should not be discounted either, since a large number of loci increases the potential for epistatic interactions, and epistasis is strongly implicated in hybrid breakdown.},

Subsequent treatments have challenged this view by pointing out that high environmental and non-additive genetic contributions to phenotypic variation may also explain the low heritability of fitness trails. Analysis of a large data set from the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis confirmed a previous finding that traits closely associated with fitness tend to have lower heritability. However, analysis of coefficients of additive genetic variation (CVA) revealed that traits closely associated with fitness had higher levels of additive genetic variation (V-A) than traits more distantly associated with fitness. Hence, the negative relationship between a trait's association with fitness and its heritability was not due to lower levels of V-A in fitness traits but was due to their higher residual variance. However, whether the high residual variance was mainly due to higher levels of environmental variance or due to higher levels of nonadditive generic variance remains a challenge to be addressed by further studies. Our results are consistent with earlier suggestions that fitness-related traits may have more complex genetic architecture than traits more distantly associated with fitness.},

Examination of data from 18 independent studies of plants and animals using both standard statistical and meta-analytical methods revealed a number Of interesting points. First, the degree of differentiation in quantitative traits (Q(ST)) typically exceeds that observed in neutral marker genes (F-ST), Suggesting a prominent role for natural selection in accounting for patterns of quantitative trait differentiation among contemporary populations. Second, the F-ST - Q(ST) difference is more pronounced for allozyme markers and morphological traits, than for other kinds of molecular markers and life- history traits. Third, very few studies reveal Situations were Q(ST) < F-ST, Suggesting that selection pressures, and bence optimal phenotypes, in different populations of the same species are Unlikely to be often similar. Fourth, there is a strong correlation between QST and F-ST indices across the different Studies for allozyme (r = 0.81), microsatellite (r = 0.87) and combined (r = 0.75) marker data, suggesting that the degree of genetic differentiation in neutral marker loci is closely predictive of the degree of differentiation in loci coding quantitative traits.

   Abstract = {Although there is Substantial evidence that skeletal measures of body size are heritable in wild animal populations, it is frequently assumed that the nonskeletal component of body weight (or 'condition') is determined primarily by environmental factors, in particular nutritional state. We tested this assumption by quantifying the genetic arid environmental components of variance in, fledgling body condition index ( = relative body weight) in a natural population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), and compared the strength of natural selection on individual breeding values with that on phenotypic values. A mixed model analysis of the components of variance, based on an 'animal model' and using 18 years of data on 17 717 nestlings, revealed a significant additive genetic component of variance in body condition, which corresponded to a narrow sense heritability (h(2)) of 0.30 (SE = 0.03). Nongenetic contributions to variation in body condition were large, but there was no evidence of dominance variance nor of contributions from early maternal or common environment effects (pre-manipulation environment) in condition at fledging. Comparison of pre- and post-selection samples revealed virtually identical h(2) of body condition index, despite the fact that there was a significant decrease (35%) in the levels of additive genetic variance from fledging to breeding, The similar h(2) in the two samples occurred because the environmental component of variance was also reduced by Selection, Suggesting that natural selection was acting on both genotypic and environmental variation. The effects of selection on genetic variance were confirmed by calculation of the selection differentials for both phenotypic values and best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) estimates of breeding values: there was positive directional selection on condition index both at the phenotypic arid the genotypic level. The significant h(2) of body condition index is consistent with data from human and rodent populations showing significant additive genetic variance in relative body mass and adiposity, but contrasts with the common assumption in ecology that body condition reflects an individual's nongenetic nutritional state. Furthermore, the substantial reduction in the additive genetic component of variance in body condition index Suggests that selection on environmental deviations cannot alone explain the maintenance of additive genetic variation in heritable traits, but that other mechanisms are needed to explain the moderate to high heritabilities of traits under consistent arid strong directional selection.},

In contrast, it is often observed that apparently heritable traits under strong and consistent directional selection fail to show the expected evolutionary response(3,4). One explanation proposed for this paradox is that a genetic response to selection may be masked by opposing changes in the environment(5,6). We used data from a 20-year study of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) to explore selection on, and evolution of, a heritable trait: relative body weight at fledging ('condition'). Despite consistent positive directional selection, on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic component (breeding values, estimated from an animal model) of condition, the mean phenotypic value of this trait in the population has declined, rather than increased, over time. Here we show that, despite this decline, the mean breeding value for condition has increased over time. The mismatch between response to selection at the levels of genotype and phenotype can be explained by environmental deterioration, concealing underlying evolution. This form of cryptic evolution may be common in natural environments.},

   Abstract = {Microevolution, defined as a change in the genetic constitution of a population over time, is considered to be of commonplace occurrence in nature. Its ubiquity can be inferred from the observation that quantitative genetic divergence among populations usually exceeds that to be expected due to genetic drift alone, and from numerous observations and experiments consistent with local adaptation. Experimental manipulations in natural populations have provided evidence that rapid evolutionary responses may occur in the wild. However, there are remarkably few cases where direct observations of natural populations have revealed microevolutionary changes occurring, despite the frequent demonstration of additive genetic variation and strong directional selection for particular traits. Those few cases where responses congruent with expectation have been demonstrated are restricted to changes over one generation. In this article we focus on possible explanations as to why heritable traits under apparently strong directional selection often fail to show the expected evolutionary response. To date, few of these explanations for apparent stasis have been amenable to empirical testing. We describe new methods, derived from procedures developed by animal breeding scientists, which can be used to address these explanations, and illustrate the approach with examples from long-term studies of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). Understanding why most intensively studied natural populations do not appear to be evolving is an important challenge for evolutionary biology.},

This propagation depends on the survival, fertility and dispersal of individuals at each age or stage during their life history, as well as on population growth and (st)age structure. Demography is therefore central to understanding evolution. Recent demographic research provides new perspectives on fitness, the spread of mutations within populations and the establishment of life histories in a phylogenetic context. New challenges resulting from individual heterogeneity, and instances where survival and reproduction are linked across generations are being recognized. Evolutionary demography is a field of exciting developments through both methodological and empirical advances. Here, we review these developments and outline two emergent research questions.},

The most detailed model generally provided the best fit to the data, though differences between models with at least one maternal effect (genetic or environmental) were often not significant. Ignoring maternal effects, direct heritability (h2) estimates were inflated substantially, in particular for growth till weaning. Significant maternal effects were found in all analyses except for final weight in Angus. There were marked differences between breeds in the relative magnitude of h2 and the maternal heritability, and the direct-maternal genetic correlation (r(AM)). For Angus, r(AM) was low, positive and not significantly different from zero for all traits. For Hereford and Zebu Cross cattle, r(AM) was negative, moderate to large for weaning weight (-0.59 and -0.78) and somewhat smaller for yearling weight (-0.48 and -0.39).

These give the covariance between measurements at any two ages as a higher order polynomial of the ages at recording. Polynomials can be fitted to full or reduced order. The former is equivalent to a multivariate analysis estimating covariance components, A reduced order fit involves less parameters and smoothes out differences in estimates of covariances.

The coefficients of covariance functions can be estimated by restricted maximum likelihood through a reparameterisation of existing algorithms to estimate covariance components. For a simple animal model with equal design matrices for all traits, computational requirements to estimate covariance functions are proportional to the order of fit for the genetic covariance function.

Results showed that records were clearly nor repeated measurements of a single trait with constant: variances. As cows grew up to about 5 years of age, variances. As cows grew up to about 5 years of age, variances increased. Estimates of genetic correlations between 3-year-old and older cows were close to unity in one herd but more erratic in the other.

Depending on the magnitude of genetic correlation, a subset of the principal component generally suffices to capture the bulk of genetic variation. Corresponding estimates of genetic covariance matrices are more parsimonious, have reduced rank and are smoothed, with the number of parameters required to model the dispersion structure reduced from k(k + 1)/2 to m(2k - m + 1)/2 for k effects and m principal components. Estimation of these parameters, the largest eigenvalues and pertaining eigenvectors of the genetic covariance matrix, via restricted maximum likelihood using derivatives of the likelihood, is described.

   Abstract = {Common principal components (CPC) analysis is a technique for assessing whether variance-covariance matrices from different populations have similar structure. One potential application is to compare additive genetic variance-covariance matrices, G. In this article, the conditions under which G matrices are expected to have common PCs are derived for a two-locus, two- allele model and the model of constrained pleiotropy. The theory demonstrates that whether G matrices are expected to have common PCs is largely determined by whether pleiotropic effects have a modular organization. If two (or more) populations have modules and these modules have the same direction, the G matrices have a common PC, regardless of allele frequencies. In the absence of modules, common PCs exist only for very restricted combinations of allele frequencies. Together, these two results imply that, when populations are evolving, common PCs are expected only when the populations have modules in common. These results have two implications: (1) In general, G matrices will not have common PCs, and (2) when they do, these PCs indicate common modular organization. The interpretation of common PCs identified for estimates of G matrices is discussed in light of these results.},

   Abstract = {It is well known that development of vision is affected by experience, but there are few studies of environmental effects on colour vision. Natural scenes contain predominantly a restricted range of reflectance spectra, so such effects might be important, perhaps biasing visual mechanisms towards common colours. We investigated how the visual environment affects colour preferences of domestic chicks (Gallus gallus), by training week-old birds to select small food containers distinguished from an achromatic alternative either by an orange or by a greenish-blue colour. Chicks that had been raised in control conditions, with long-wavelength-dominated reflectance spectra, responded more readily to orange than to blue. This was not due to avoidance of blue, as increasing saturation enhanced the chicks' preference for the same hue. The advantage of orange was, however, reduced or abolished for chicks raised in an environment dominated by blue objects. This indicates that responses to coloured food are affected by experience of non-food objects. If colours of ordinary objects in the environment do influence responses to specialised visual signals this might help explain why biological signals directed at birds are often coloured yellow, orange or red; long- wavelength-dominated spectra being more prevalent than short- wavelength-dominated spectra.},

This approach allows heritabilities to be estimated in natural populations that violate the assumptions of offspring-parent regression methods. Maternal (or paternal) effects can also be estimated under natural conditions. We demonstrate that all the traits, body weight, hind leg length and incisor arcade breadth, have low but significant heritabilities. Body weight, the trait that experiences the strongest selection, had the lowest heritability but the highest additive genetic coefficient of variation. An evolutionary response to selection is predicted. When maternal effects were not taken into consideration heritabilities were over-estimated, although this effect was only significant in female offspring.},

To do this, I examined body size evolution in each of six major clades of cryptodiran turtles and also across the whole tree of cryptodirans (n = 201 taxa). Extant cryptodiran turtles do not appear to follow Cope's rule, as no clade showed a significant phyletic body size trend. Previous analyses in other extant vertebrates have also found no evidence for phyletic size increase, which is in contrast to the paleontological data that support the rule in a number of extinct vertebrate taxa.},

Tail length increased with the first molt, but remained constant during subsequent years. Changes in tail length between years, owing to molt were significantly affected by sex and by degree of infection with an haematophagous mite (Ornithonyssus bursa). There were significant differences in sexual size dimorphism between years, apparently as a result of environmental conditions in the African winter quarters during molt. Tail length was a highly repeatable morphological trait, and standardization of tail length for age effects only marginally increased repeatability. Heritability of tail length as estimated from regression of values for sons on those of their fathers was 0.59.

This hypothesis was tested for males of the migratory and sexually size-dimorphic barn swallow Hirundo rustica. The major cost of early arrival is poor environmental conditions which resulted in mortality of short-tailed early-arriving males in one year. The major benefits of early arrival are higher mating success, enhanced reproductive success, improved recruitment rates for offspring, and enhanced quality of the mate acquired. Annual variation in male arrival date is related to weather conditions at the breeding grounds, but also to some extent to weather conditions in the African winter quarters. Individual variation in arrival time can be explained by phenotype-dependent cost and benefit functions of early arrival. Male barn swallows with long tail ornaments arrived earlier than short-tailed males. The costs of early arrival should be particularly high under poor environmental conditions and lead to a stronger negative relationship between arrival date and phenotypic quality in years with poor environmental conditions. This prediction was confirmed by a stronger negative relationship between male tail length and date of arrival in years when arrival was relatively late because of poor weather. A female preference for early- arriving males may result in acquisition of good genes for optimal migratory behaviour, if migratory direction and extent have a genetic basis as shown in a number of different bird species.},

   Abstract = {A positive association between plumage brightness of male birds and the degree of polygyny may be the result of sexual selection. Although most birds have a socially monogamous mating system, recent paternity analyses show that many offspring are fathered by nonmates. Extrapair paternity arises from extrapair copulations which are frequently initiated by females. Not all females will be able to mate with a male of the preferred phenotype, because of the mating decisions of earlier paired females; extrapair copulations may be a means for females to adjust their precopulation mate choice. We use two comparative analyses (standardized linear contrasts and pairwise comparisons between closely related taxa) to test the idea that male plumage brightness is related to extrapair paternity. Brightness of male plumage and sexual dimorphism in brightness were positively associated with high levels of extrapair paternity, even when potentially confounding variables were controlled statistically. This association between male brightness and extrapair paternity was considerably stronger than the association between male brightness and the degree of polygyny. Cuckoldry thus forms an important component of sexual selection in birds.},

A test of this assumption was performed using the sexually exaggerated outermost tail feathers of male barn swallows Hirundo rustica, a trait currently subject of a directional female mate preference. A possible cost of sexual signalling in male barn swallows arises from increased flight cost during foraging in this aerially insectivorous species. A longer tail may impose a greater drag during Eight and thereby affect foraging ability. This was tested by determining the relationship between experimentally modified male tail lengths and number and size of prey delivered to offspring in Spain, where sexual size dimorphism in tail length is small, compared to Denmark, where dimorphism is large. Food boluses contained significantly fewer small insects in Spain than in Denmark. Males with elongated tails captured more and smaller insects while males with shortened tails captured fewer and larger prey items at both sites. Males with naturally long tails were less affected by experimental treatment in terms of effects on the number and the size of prey delivered to their offspring, a finding consistent with a long tail being a condition-dependent viability indicator. The effect of a given degree of tail manipulation on prey size and number of prey per bolus was larger in Spain than in Denmark. These results demonstrate that (1) tail length in male barn swallows affects foraging, and (2) larger sexual size dimorphism occurs where the foraging cost of an increment in ornament size is smallest.},

These predictions were tested for the nominate subspecies of the barn swallow Hirundo rustica which demonstrates clinal variation in morphology, with several characters in both sexes showing increasing size at higher latitudes. Sexual size dimorphism in the length of the tail ornament and the short, central tail feathers increase with increasing latitude while size dimorphism in other morphological characters is independent of latitude. The main reason for the two divergent patterns of sexual size dimorphism appears to be the higher foraging cost of having a long tail ornamental at low latitudes. The control of development decreases with increasing latitude as demonstrated by an increasing latitudinal dine in fluctuating asymmetry of tail length. Phenotypic variance in tail length increases with latitude in males, but not in females, as shown by the coefficients of variation. Clinal variation in morphology is not due to natural selection associated with a latitudinal increase in the distance between breeding and wintering areas. The geographic patterns of morphological variation suggest that the tail character has diverged geographically as a result of a sexual process of reliable signalling.},

If sexually dichromatic species have experienced a long period of antagonistic coevolution with their parasites, such species should have evolved larger immune defence organs than sexually monochromatic species. Bird species with sexual dichromatism had larger spleens for their body size than monochromatic species in a comparative analysis. Furthermore, species with a high frequency of extra-pair paternity were sexually dichromatic and had large spleens for their body size.

   Abstract = {The hypothesis that sexual selection promotes speciation has rarely been tested. We identified 70 evolutionarily independent events of feather ornaments in birds. For each focal species we noted the number of ornamented and nonornamented species belonging to its genus and its number of subspecies, as well as its mating system and the extent of its geographic range. For purposes of comparison, we randomly chose a second, nonornamented species for which we obtained information on the number of subspecies, and in cases in which the nonornamented species was in the same genus, we chose a third, nonornamented species in a related genus and obtained the same information. We then noted the number of species in each genus and the difference in numbers of species, or species richness, between paired genera. For the genera of the focal ornamented species, we regressed number of ornamented species on number of nonornamented species and found a positive relationship. As number of species per genus rose, number of ornamented species per genus rose more rapidly, indicating that more speciose genera have a higher proportion of ornamented species than less speciose genera. We then took the deviations from this regression, the residual number of species, and regressed them on the differences in species richness between the paired genera. This relationship was positive indicating that ornamented genera with more than the expected number of ornamented species were more speciose with respect to their paired genera than were genera with fewer than the expected number of ornamented species. Finally, we compared the deviations from this regression, the residual number of ornamented species, with species' mating system and found a greater residual number of ornamented species among species whose mating system is associated with greater skew in male mating success and thus more intense sexual selection. Ornamented species had more subspecies than nonornamented species, even when controlling for geographic range, suggesting an association between subspeciation and ornaments.},

   Abstract = {Parasites have been hypothesized to affect sexual selection of their hosts, if secondary sexual characters reliably signal absence of infectious parasites, superior parenting ability caused by the absence of parasites, or heritable resistance to parasites, for which there is some intraspecific and interspecific evidence. Measures of immune defence of hosts provide reliable information on the current infection status of individuals of the chosen sex, usually males, and correlations between immune defence and development of secondary sexual characters thus provide a novel critical test of parasite- mediated sexual selection. In a comparative study of birds, sexually dichromatic species had higher immune defences, measured in terms of leukocyte concentration and the size of spleen and bursa of Fabricius, respectively, than closely related, monochromatic species. Male plumage brightness was consistently negatively related to the size of the spleen in males of sexually dichromatic species, but not in males of monochromatic species. Hence, the brightest males, which frequently are preferred as mates by choosy females, had low levels of immune defence, suggesting that such males were healthy. This provides evidence for a general role of parasites in sexual selection among their bird hosts.},

Studies of specific host-parasite systems and comparative analyses have revealed bath supportive and conflicting evidence for these hypotheses. A meta-analysis of the available evidence revealed a negative relationship between parasite load and the expression of male secondary sexual characters. Experimental studies yielded more strongly negative relationships than observations did, and the relationships were more strongly negative for ectoparasites than for endoparasites. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of the negative effect for species with and without male parental care, or Between behavioral and morphological secondary sexual characters. There was a significant difference between studies based on host immune function and those based on parasite loads, with stronger effects for measures of immune function, suggesting that the many negative results from previous analyses of parasite- mediated sexual selection may be explained because relatively benign parasites were studied. The multivariate analyses demonstrating strong effect sizes of immune function in relation to the expression of secondary sexual characters, and for species with male parental care as compared to those without, suggest that parasite resistance may be a general determinant of parasite-mediated sexual selection.},

The average correlation coefficient between male traits and offspring survival in 22 studies was 0.122, which differed highly significantly from zero. This implies that male characters chosen by females reveal on average 1.5% of the variance in viability. The studies demonstrated considerable heterogeneity in effect size; some of this heterogeneity could be accounted for by differences among taxa (birds demonstrating stronger effects), and by differences in the degree of mating skew in the species (high skew reflecting stronger effects). Although these results suggest that viability-based sexual selection is widespread across taxa, they indicate that the effect is relatively minor. Finally, there was also an effect of publication year in that the more recent studies reported reduced effects. This may reflect publication biases during paradigm shifts of this debated issue, but it should also be recalled that the studies have only partly estimated the full fitness consequences of mate choice for offspring.},

The repeatability was statistically significant and the heritability of arrival date was estimated to be 0.54 (s.e. =0.15). There was no significant evidence of this estimate being inflated by environmental or maternal condition during rearing. Arrival date and migration are condition dependent in the barn swallow, with males with the most exaggerated secondary sexual characters also arriving the earliest. There was a significant genetic correlation between arrival date and tail length in male barn swallows, providing indirect evidence for a genetic basis of this condition dependence. Given the high level of heritability, arrival date could readily respond to selection caused by environmental change.},

   Abstract = {Females may choose mates based on the expression of secondary sexual characters that signal direct, material fitness benefits or indirect, genetic fitness benefits. Genetic benefits are acquired in the generation subsequent to that in which mate choice is performed, and the maintenance of genetic variation in viability has been considered a theoretical problem. Consequently, the magnitude of indirect benefits has traditionally been considered to be small. Direct fitness benefits can be maintained without consideration of mechanisms sustaining genetic variability, and they have thus been equated with the default benefits acquired by choosy females. There is, however, still debate as to whether or not males should honestly advertise direct benefits such as their willingness to invest in parental care. We use meta-analysis to estimate the magnitude of direct fitness benefits in terms of fertility, fecundity and two measures of paternal care (feeding rate in birds, hatching rate in male guarding ectotherms) based on an extensive literature survey. The mean coefficients of determination weighted by sample size were 6.3%, 2.3%, 1.3% and 23.6%, respectively. This compares to a mean weighted coefficient of determination of 1.5% for genetic viability benefits in studies of sexual selection. Thus, for several fitness components, direct benefits are only slightly more important than indirect ones arising from female choice. Hatching rate in mate guarding ectotherms was by far the most important direct fitness component, explaining almost a quarter of the variance. Our analysis also shows that mate sexual advertisements do not always reliably signal direct fitness benefits.},

   Pages = {1352-1362},
   Abstract = {Interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by interactions with conspecifics. Commonly-studied interacting phenotypes include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples of interacting phenotypes - traits that exist exclusively as a product of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive ability, and mating systems. We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve. Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to the phenotype. We then explore the ramifications of this model of inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect genetic contributions. The available empirical evidence regarding the evolution of behavior expressed in interactions, although limited, supports the predictions of our model.},

The method offers a much more refined characterization of selection than attempting to assign paternity to individual progeny. Our analysis of R. raphanistrum reveals selection on remarkably fine features of floral morphology, including anther exsertion, that were opaque to previous approaches. The new results also undermine a previous conclusion that selection on wild radish floral morphology acts primarily through female fitness. Simulation results show that selection gradients on the order of beta = 0.1-0.2 can be readily detected with allozyme markers in moderate-sized (< 200 paternal individuals) populations. Highly polymorphic (e.g., microsatellite) markers will likely detect fine scale selection (<beta> < 0.1) in larger populations (<greater than or equal to> 400 individuals). Increased progeny sample size, by sampling either additional maternal families or more progeny per maternal parent, partly compensates for low exclusion probability. Increasing the number of possible fathers without changing progeny sample size decreases the ability to detect selection, especially at lower exclusion probabilities. Sampling only some male genotypes reduces the power to detect selection and biases (underestimates) the magnitude of the selection gradient estimate.},

As a result, molecular parentage analyses are expected to benefit when allowances are made for the presence of genotypic errors. However, a cost of allowing for genotypic errors might also be expected under some analytical conditions, primarily because parentage analyses that assume nonzero genotypic error rates can neither assign nor exclude parentage with certainty. The goal of this work was therefore to determine whether or not such costs might be important under conditions relevant to parentage analyses, particularly in natural populations. Simulation results indicate that the costs may often outweigh the benefits of accounting for nonzero error rates, except in situations where data are available for many marker loci. Consequently, the most powerful approach to handling genotypic errors in parentage analyses might be to apply likelihood equations with error rates set to values substantially lower than the rates at which genotypic errors occur. When applying molecular parentage analyses to natural populations, we advocate an increased consideration of optimal strategies for handling genotypic errors. Currently available software packages contain procedures that can be used for this purpose.},

Heritabilities ranged from 0.20 for weight, 0.38 for length, 0.67 for precocious male maturation ('jacking') to 0.76 for flesh colour, which are in good agreement with estimates for salmonids generated using classical quantitative genetic methods.

Adaptive hypotheses propose that aggression from after 2nd-year (ASY) males or predation favors DPM in 2nd-year (SY) males, thereby increasing SY male survivorship or reproductive success. However, each hypothesis suggests a distinct selective mechanism explaining ''how'' this is accomplished. Alternatively, DPM may be a consequence of a nonadaptive molt constraint. We tested the female mimicry and status signalling hypotheses in territorial ASY male lazuli buntings (Passerina amoena) using three sets of model presentation experiments. The female mimicry hypothesis proposes that dull SY male plumage deceptively mimics female plumage, and predicts that ASY males can not distinguish SY male from female plumage. The status signalling hypothesis proposes that dull SY male plumage honestly signals low competitive threat, and predicts that ASY males respond less aggressively to dull versus bright, ASY-like plumage. Contrary to the female mimicry hypothesis, ASY males distinguished between SY male and female plumage, as they were aggressive to SY male models exclusively and attempted to copulate with female models. Supporting the status signalling hypothesis, ASY males were significantly less aggressive to SY versus ASY male plumage. While DPM may result from a physiological constraint on bright SY male plumage, our results support the idea that dull plumage in an SY male's first breeding season may be maintained by selection to reduce aggression from ASY males, serving as a signal of competitive status.},

The usual quantitative genetic model ignores these competitive interactions and could result in seriously incorrect breeding decisions and acerbate animal well-being. A general solution to this problem is given, for either forest tree breeding or penned animals, with mixed-model methodology (BLUP) utilized to separate effects on the phenotype due to the individuals' own genes (direct effects) and those from competing individuals (associative effects) and thereby to allow an optimum index selection on those effects. Biological verification was based on two lines of Japanese quail selected for 6-week weight; one line was selected only for direct effects (D-BLUP) while the other was selected on an optimal index for both direct and associative effects (C-BLUP). Results over 23 cycles of selection showed that C-BLUP produced a significant positive response to selection (b = 0.52 +/- 0.25 g/hatch) whereas D-BLUP resulted in a nonsignificant negative response (b = -0.10 +/- 0.25 g/hatch). The regression of percentage of mortality on hatch number was significantly different between methods, decreasing with C-BLUP (b = -0.06 +/- 0.15 deaths/hatch) and increasing with D-BLUP (b = 0.32 +/- 0.15 deaths/hatch). These results demonstrate that the traditional D-BLUP approach without associative effects not only is detrimental to response to selection but also compromises the well-being of animals. The differences in response show that competitive effects can be included in breeding programs, without measuring new traits, so that costs of the breeding program need not increase.},

The plasticity observed in the timing of breeding can be explained either as an adaptation to the best time for rearing young or as determined by changing environmental conditions prior to laying. We related the variation in timing of breeding and breeding success to local temperature and food abundance. For the most part, spring temperature (but also caterpillar abundance and low temperature around the expected start of egg laying) as well as the presence of the birds in their breeding territories during the previous winter explained within- population variation in timing. Intraindividual variation in timing showed a plastic response to changes in environmental conditions prior to laying, but the plasticities did not differ among individuals. Birds raising their young when food was most abundant were the most successful breeders. The most productive laying date differed significantly among years because unpredictable yearly fluctuations in environmental conditions after the birds started laying still affected the development of caterpillars. In addition to being affected by changes in environmental conditions early in the season, the laying dates of experienced tits were affected by the difference between their timing and the caterpillars' timing in the previous year. Thus, great tits adjust their timing to the best time for rearing young, but variation in environmental conditions will maintain variation in timing.},

Little, however, is known about environmental effects on steroid synthesis in nestlings. We addressed this question by following the development of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) chicks that were cross-fostered and raised in different brood sizes. In line with previous findings, nestling growth and cell-mediated immunocompetence were negatively affected by brood size. Moreover, nestling testosterone levels covaried with treatment: plasma testosterone increased with experimental brood size.

   Abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers.

   Abstract = {Current statistical methods for estimating nest survival rates assume that nests are identical in their propensity to succeed. However, there are several biological reasons to question this assumption. For example, experience of the nest builder, number of nest helpers, genetic fitness of individuals, and site effects may contribute to an inherent disparity between nests with respect to their daily mortality rates. Ignoring such heterogeneity can lead to incorrect survival estimates. Our results show that constant survival models can seriously underestimate overall survival in the presence of heterogeneity. This paper presents a flexible random-effects approach to model heterogeneous nest survival data. We illustrate our methods through data on redwing blackbirds.},

We identify two forms of multiple mating: 'single-sex', where the next-generation individuals (NGIs) are the product of multiple mating by one sex; and 'two-sex', where the NGIs are the product of multiple mating by both sexes. For both mating systems we develop models that estimate the proportion of NGIs that is fathered (paternity) or mothered (maternity) by the putative parents. The models only require genetic data from the parent or parents in question and the sample of NGIs, as well as an estimate of population allele frequencies. The models provide unbiased estimates, can accommodate loci with many alleles and are robust to violations of their assumptions. They allow researchers to address intractable problems such as the parentage of seeds found on the ground, juvenile fish in a stream, and nestlings in a communal breeding bird. We demonstrate the models using genetic data from a nest of the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, where the NGIs may be from multiple females that have spawned with multiple males from different life histories (cuckolder and parental).},

   Abstract = {We develop fractional allocation models and confidence statistics for parentage analysis in mating systems. The models can be used, for example, to estimate the paternities of candidate males when the genetic mother is known or to calculate the parentage of candidate parent pairs when neither is known. The models do not require two implicit assumptions made by previous models, assumptions that are potentially erroneous. First, we provide formulas to calculate the expected parentage, as opposed to using a maximum likelihood algorithm to calculate the most likely parentage. The expected parentage is superior as it does not assume a symmetrical probability distribution of parentage and therefore, unlike the most likely parentage, will be unbiased. Second, we provide a mathematical framework for incorporating additional biological data to estimate the prior probability distribution of parentage. This additional biological data might include behavioral observations during mating or morphological measurements known to correlate with parentage. The value of multiple sources of information is increased accuracy of the estimates. We show that when the prior probability of parentage is known, and the expected parentage is calculated, fractional allocation provides unbiased estimates of the variance in reproductive success, thereby correcting a problem that has previously plagued parentage analyses. We also develop formulas to calculate the confidence interval in the parentage estimates, thus enabling the assessment of precision. These confidence statistics have not previously been available for fractional models. We demonstrate our models with several biological examples based on data from two fish species that we study, coho salmon (Oncorhychus kisutch) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), In coho, multiple males compete to fertilize a single female's eggs. We show how behavioral observations taken during spawning can be combined with genetic data to provide an accurate calculation of each male's paternity. In bluegill, multiple males and multiple females may mate in a single nest. For a nest, we calculate the fertilization success and the 95% confidence interval of each candidate parent pair.

   Abstract = {Many breeding systems have multiple mating, in which males or females mate with multiple partners. With the advent of molecular markers, it is now possible to detect multiple mating in nature. However, no model yet exists to effectively assess the frequency of multiple mating (f(mm))-the proportion of broods with at least two males (or females) genetically contributing-from limited genetic data. We present a single-sex model based on Bayes' rule that incorporates the numbers of loci, alleles, offspring, and genetic parents. Two genetic criteria for calculating f(mm) are considered: the proportion of broods with three or more paternal (or maternal) alleles at any one locus and the total number of haplotypes observed in each brood. The former criterion provides the most precise estimates of f(mm). The model enables the calculation of confidence intervals and allows mutations (or typing errors) to be incorporated into the calculation. Failure to account for mutations can result in overestimates of f(mm). The model can also utilize other biological data, such as behavioral observations during mating, thereby increasing the accuracy of the calculation as compared to previous models. For example, when two sires contribute equally to multiply mated broods, only three loci with five equally common alleles are required to provide estimates of fmm with high precision. We demonstrate the model with an example addressing the frequency of multiple paternity in small versus large clutches of the endangered Kemp's Ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempi) and show that females that lay large clutches are more likely to have multiply mated.},

Variation in carotenoid-dependent skin colour between winter and spring (mating season) was investigated, as was variation in plasma carotenoids across the breeding season in captive American Kestrels, Falco sparverius, fed a uniform diet. 4. Kestrels were more brightly coloured in the mating period than in winter, and plasma carotenoid concentrations declined from the time of mating to the rearing of young. 5. Although carotenoid levels were highly sexually dimorphic during mating and laying, males and both breeding and non-breeding females all had similar levels by the incubation period, and the pattern of variation over time suggests rheostatic regulation. 6. These results suggest kestrels may have the ability to regulate (rather than merely control) their colour physiologically, the variation in colour and carotenoids is consistent with that expected of a sexually selected trait, and the loss of colour after breeding may suggest a trade-off between the show and health functions of carotenoids.},

Variation in both plasma carotenoid levels and external color may reflect different access to dietary carotenoids or individual physiological differences in the uptake and deposition of carotenoids. We compared total plasma carotenoid concentration in nestling white storks (Ciconia ciconia) from 11 Spanish colonies in two consecutive years. The main food item in one of the colonies was the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), a recently introduced species. Storks in the remaining colonies ate a variety of foods but no crayfish. Total plasma carotenoid levels in the colony where crayfish were consumed were about five times higher than in any other colony. These differences were maintained after controlling for the significant interyear variability, as well as for sex, age, and body mass of birds. Skin pigmentation also differed, being intensely orange in storks that consumed crayfish but white (unpigmented) in the remaining individuals. With thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and electronic absorption spectroscopy, astaxanthin was confirmed as the major carotenoid in crayfish as well as in the plasma, skin, and body fat of crayfish-eating storks, whereas lutein was the main carotenoid in plasma samples from the other colonies. These results indicate that a newly available carotenoid in the environment, astaxanthin, can be absorbed in large quantities from the gut and be transported in the blood before deposition in different tissues.},

Males presented higher values than females of their same age group, except in the last sampling period in summer. Adult partridges (2-year old) presented significantly higher carotenoid levels than first-year birds at the beginning of the study, but this age effect was not constant throughout the season. The sex-specific variation in plasma carotenoids cannot be attributed to diet, as this was the same for all individuals across the study. Body mass, and thus condition, did not change significantly across the study, and was therefore not related to seasonal variation in plasma carotenoids.

   Abstract = {1. Carotenoids are responsible for the most striking colours in birds, but also play an important role as enhancers of the immune system. Consequently, a trade-off between the ornamental and health functions of carotenoids in birds has been proposed. 2. Although it is well known that birds can store carotenoids in different organs and tissues, including the fat stores, until now all field studies of the regulation of carotenoid stores have focused on plasma carotenoids. 3. Carotenoids in the fat of 44 wild Greylag Geese (Anser anser L.) wintering in south-western Spain were identified and quantified. In addition, the relationships between carotenoids and the size of the fat stores, as well as the sex and age of the geese, were analysed. 4. The major carotenoid in goose fat was lutein. This and related carotenoids are also the most prevalent pigments in bird plasma and secondary sexual characters. We also detected beta -cryptoxanthin, beta -carotene, neochrome and neoxanthin. Total carotenoid concentration was negatively correlated with the size of the fat stores. Males had higher concentrations of carotenoids than females. 5. A possible explanation for these patterns is that male birds tend to have higher plasma carotenoids than females, a difference that could be transposed to fat if carotenoids diffused passively from the blood into adipose tissues. Carotenoids, however, may tend to remain in the fat stores. If this were true, fat would not be a reservoir of carotenoids, but a sink where a significant amount of these pigments would be sequestered, being no longer available for other functions.},

We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), maximum metabolic rate for thermoregulation (MMR), thermal conductance (C-T), body temperature (T-b), and factorial aerobic scope (FAS) in individuals acclimated to cold and warm conditions. For comparability with previous studies, we included the following morphological traits: foot length (F- L), total length (T-L), body mass (m(b), at birth, sexual maturity, 6 months, and 8 months). Variance components were obtained from two different procedures: the expected variance component in an ANOVA Type III sum of squares and an animal model approach using restricted maximum likelihood. Results suggest the presence of additive genetic variance in F-L (h(2) = 0.47, P = 0.045), C-T of cold-acclimated animals (h(2) = 0.66, P = 0.041). and night body temperature, measured in cold- acclimated animals (h(2) = 0.68, P = 0.080). Heritabilities of rub were near zero at all ages, but maternal effects and common environment effects were high and significant. We found no evidence of additive genetic variance in BMR, NST, MMR, or FAS (i.e., estimates were not significantly different from zero for all tests). Our results are in general agreement with previous studies of mammals that reported low heritability for: (1) BMR and MMR; (2) daytime body temperature; and (3) body mass for wild, but not laboratory or domestic, populations.},

   Abstract = {We present two novel methods to infer mating patterns from genetic data. They differ from existing statistical methods of parentage inference in that they apply to populations that deviate from Hardy - Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, and so are suited for the study of assortative mating in hybrid zones. The core data set consists of genotypes at several loci for a number of full-sib clutches of unknown parentage. Our inference is based throughout on estimates of allelic associations within and across loci, such as heterozygote deficit and pairwise linkage disequilibrium. In the first method, the most likely parents of a given clutch are determined from the genotypic distribution of the associated adult population, given an explicit model of nonrandom mating. This leads to estimates of the strength of assortment. The second approach is based solely on the offspring genotypes and relies on the fact that a linear relation exists between associations among the offspring and those in the population of breeding pairs. We apply both methods to a sample from the hybrid zone between the fire- bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata ( Anura: Disco glossidae) in Croatia.

Continued selection on plasticity can act to alleviate this mismatch.},

We use compound-specific stable isotope analysis of carbon (GC/combustion/isotope ratio MS) to investigate the dietary sources of egg amino acids in a nectar-feeding hawkmoth. Previous work suggests that the nutrients used in egg manufacture fall into two classes: those that are increasingly synthesized from adult dietary sugar over a female's lifetime (renewable resources), and those that remain exclusively larval in origin (nonrenewable resources). We predict that nonessential and essential amino acids correspond to these nutrient classes and test this prediction by analyzing egg amino acids from females fed isotopically distinct diets as larvae and as adults. The results demonstrate that essential egg amino acids originate entirely from the larval diet. In contrast, nonessential egg amino acids were increasingly synthesized from adult dietary sugars, following a turnover pattern across a female's lifetime. This study demonstrates that female Lepidoptera can synthesize a large fraction of egg amino acids from nectar sugars, using endogenous sources of nitrogen. However, essential amino acids derive only from the larval diet, placing an upper limit on the use of adult dietary resources to enhance reproductive success.},

   Abstract = {To gain insights into the evolution and ecology of visually acute animals such as birds, biologists often need to understand how these animals perceive colors. This poses a problem, since the human eye is of a different design than that of most other animals. The standard solution is to examine the spectral sensitivity properties of animal retinas through microspectophotometry-a procedure that is rather complicated and therefore only has allowed examinations of a limited number of species to date. We have developed a faster and simpler molecular method, which can be used to estimate the color sensitivities of a bird by sequencing a part of the gene coding for the ultraviolet or violet absorbing opsin in the avian retina. With our method, there is no need to sacrifice the animal, and it thereby facilitates large screenings, including rare and endangered species beyond the reach of microspectrophotometry. Color vision in birds may be categorized into two classes: one with a short-wavelength sensitivity biased toward violet (VS) and the other biased toward ultraviolet (UVS). Using our method on 45 species from 35 families, we demonstrate that the distribution of avian color vision is more complex than has previously been shown. Our data support VS as the ancestral state in birds and show that UVS has evolved independently at least four times. We found species with the UVS type of color vision in the orders Psittaciformes and Passeriformes, in agreement with previous findings. However, species within the families Corvidae and Tyrannidae did not share this character with other passeriforms. We also found UVS type species within the Laridae and Struthionidae families. Raptors (Accipitridae and Falconidae) are of the violet type, giving them a vision system different from their passeriform prey. Intriguing effects on the evolution of color signals can be expected from interactions between predators and prey. Such interactions may explain the presence of UVS in Laridae and Passeriformes.},

None of the three techniques is wholly satisfactory: one implies that group selection can operate even if individual fitness is determined by individual phenotype alone, whereas the other two imply that group selection can operate even if there is no variance in group fitness. This has significant implications both for our understanding of what the term "multilevel selection" means and for the traditional concept of group selection.},

Fitting a two-part random-effects model poses computational challenges similar to those found with generalized linear mixed models.

However, the processes that might generate such convergence have not been explored theoretically. Furthermore, no studies have rigorously addressed this issue using a robust phylogeny and a large number of signal characters. We scored the appearance of 44 adult male plumage characters that varied across New World orioles (Icterus). We mapped the plumage characters onto a molecular phylogeny based on two mitochondrial genes. Reconstructing the evolution of these characters revealed evidence of convergence or reversal in 42 of the 44 plumage characters. No plumage character states are restricted to any groups of species higher than superspecies in the oriole phylogeny. The high frequency of convergence and reversal is reflected in the low overall retention index (RI = 0.66) and the low overall consistency index (CI = 0.28). We found similar results when we mapped plumage changes onto a total evidence tree. Our findings reveal that plumage patterns and colors are highly labile between species of orioles, but highly conserved within the oriole genus. Furthermore, there are at least two overall plumage types that have convergently evolved repeatedly in the three oriole clades. This overall convergence leads to significant conflict between the molecular and plumage data. It is not clear what evolutionary processes lead to this homoplasy in individual characters or convergence in overall pattern. However, evolutionary constraints such as developmental limitations and genetic correlations between characters are likely to play a role. Our results are consistent with the belief that avian plumage and other sexually selected characters may evolve rapidly and may exhibit high homoplasy. The overall convergence in oriole plumage patterns is an interesting evolutionary phenomenon, but it cautions against heavy reliance on plumage characters for constructing phylogenies.},

Furthermore, studies in England and Sweden have yielded somewhat different results (particularly with regard to the spectral position of the reflectance peak). Here we investigate whether the blue tit UV/blue ornament varies with time of year since such variation might be relevant to the signalling function as well as the apparent difference between populations. From 400 blue tits captured at two different localities in Sweden, we found that objective measures of 'hue' (spectral location), 'chroma' (spectral purity) and 'brightness' (spectral intensity), varied substantially with season. Just after moult (October), crown 'hue' is maximally UV-shifted (359 nm for males and 373 nm for females). Thereafter the peak drifts upwards and by the time of nestling feeding (June) male reflectance peaks at 404 nm and female at 413 nm. This change is probably due to feather wear as well as fat and dirt accumulation, which might constitute an additional male quality cue. Our results suggest that it is important to consider plumage age when exploring variation in structural plumage coloration, and that it can largely explain the difference between the British and Swedish studies.

One possibility is that stimulus values are judged accurately - so, for example, a female might choose a suitor if he displays a specific colour [3]. Alternatively, as for human advertising, displays may attract attention without giving information, perhaps by exploiting innate preferences for bright colours or symmetry [2,4,5]. To address this issue experimentally, we investigated chicks' memories of visual patterns. Food was placed in patterned paper containers which, like seed pods or insect prey, must be manipulated to extract food and their patterns learnt. To establish what was learnt, birds were tested on familiar stimuli and on alternative stimuli of differing colour or contrast. For colour, birds selected the trained stimulus; for contrast, they preferred high contrast patterns over the familiar. These differing responses to colour and contrast show how separate components of display patterns could serve different roles, with colour being judged accurately whereas pattern contrast attracts attention.},

We start by briefly reviewing work on evolutionary function of eyes and neural mechanisms of vision. Often mechanisms used for achromatic vision are accurately modeled as adaptations for detection and recognition of the generality of optical stimuli, rather than specific stimuli such as biological signals. Colour vision is less well understood, but for photoreceptor spectral sensitivities of birds and hymenopterans there is no evidence for adaptations to species-specific stimuli, such as those of food or mates. Turning to experimental work, we investigate how achromatic and chromatic stimuli are used for object recognition by foraging domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Chicks use chromatic and achromatic signals in different ways: discrimination of large targets uses (chromatic) colour differences, and chicks remember chromatic signals accurately. However, detection of small targets, and discrimination of visual textures requires achromatic contrast. The different roles of chromatic and achromatic information probably reflect their utility for object recognition in nature. Achromatic (intensity) variation exceeds chromatic variation, and hence is more informative about change in reflectance - for example, object borders, while chromatic signals yield more information about surface reflectance (object colour) under variable illumination.},

The spectral tuning of interference colours often varies with angles of illumination and reflection, which produces iridescence. Iridescence and other optical effects mean that interference coloration looks different from pigmentation and is visually striking. To study the optical and visual properties of structural plumage colours, we recorded the reflectance spectra of feathers and in particular their directional properties. A fixed spot on a feather was viewed from a fixed position, whilst the feather orientation and the angle of illumination were varied. We recognise two main types of coloration, 'directional' and 'diffuse'.

However, it has proved remarkably difficult to find a convincing ecological explanation for why different organisms are at different positions along this line. This is surprising because life-history traits are generally considered to be closely connected to fitness. Here, we test four candidate variables which represent competing ecological explanations for the origin of avian life-history diversity. food type; foraging range; developmental mode; and nesting habit. First, we find that over 90% of the variation in key life-history traits occurs among lineages corresponding to the phylogenetic level of between families or above. This suggests that variation among living species is almost entirely due to events which occurred in the ancient evolutionary history of birds. Hence we use minor-axis regression models to quantify the direction and magnitude of ancient changes in 'reproductive effort'. We then test for ecological correlates of these ancient changes. Of the four ecological variables tested, only changes in nesting habit are significantly correlated with ancient changes in 'reproductive effort'. The adoption of safe nest sites among archaic birds is consistently associated with reduced 'reproductive effort'. We suggest that life-history variation among living birds is largely due to diversification in nesting habit which occurred over 40 Ma sp, between the Cretaceous and Eocene.},

   Pages = {1103-1110},
   Abstract = {Since most bird species are socially monogamous, variation among species in social mating systems is determined largely by variation in the frequency of mate desertion. Mate desertion is expected to occur when the benefits, in terms of additional reproductive opportunities, outweigh the costs, in terms of reduced reproductive success from the present brood. However, despite much research, the relative importance of costs and benefits in explaining mating system variation is not well understood. Here, we investigate this problem using a comparative method. We analyse changes in the frequency of mate desertion at different phylogenetic levels. Differences between orders and families in the frequency of desertion are negatively associated with changes in the potential costs of desertion, but are not associated with changes in the potential benefits of desertion. Conversely, differences among genera and species in the frequency of desertion are positively associated with increases in the potential benefits of desertion, but not with changes in the potential costs of desertion. Hence, we suggest that mate desertion in birds originates through a combination of evolutionary predisposition and ecological facilitation. In particular, ancient changes in life-history strategy determine the costs of desertion and predispose certain lineages to polygamy, while contemporary changes in the distribution of resources determine the benefits of desertion and thereby the likelihood that polygamy will be viable within these lineages. Thus, monogamy can arise via two very different evolutionary pathways. Groups such as albatrosses (Procellariidae) are constrained to social monogamy by the high cost to desertion, irrespective of the potential benefits. However, in groups such as the accentors (Prunellidae), which are predisposed to desertion, monogamy occurs only when the benefits of desertion are very limited. These conclusions emphasise the additional power which a hierarchical approach contributes to the modern comparative method.},

   Abstract = {Variation in the extent of sexual dimorphism among bird species is traditionally attributed to differences in social mating system. However, there are many different forms of dimorphism among birds, and not all of them show an obvious correlation with social mating system. For example, recent work has shown that many highly polygamous species are, in fact, monomorphic, whereas many putatively monogamous species are dimorphic. In this paper we break up sexual dimorphism into subcomponents and then use comparative analyses to examine the pattern of covariation between these subcomponents and various aspects of sexual, social, and parental behaviour. Our first finding is that size dimorphism and plumage-colour dimorphism do not show the same pattern of covariation. Differences in size dimorphism are associated with variation in social mating system and sex differences in parental care, whereas differences in plumage- colour dimorphism are associated with variation in the frequency of extra-bond paternity. These results suggest that size dimorphism is associated with the sort of intrasexual competition described by traditional classifications of social mating system, whereas plumage-colour dimorphism is associated with cryptic female choice. However, when we break up plumage- colour dimorphism according to whether it is due to melanins, carotenoids or structural colours, we find that each category of plumage-colour dimorphism shows a different pattern of covariation. The correlation between overall plumage-colour dimorphism and the rate of extra-bond paternity is due to structural colours, whereas melanin-based dimorphism is associated with sex differences in parental care. The former result is particularly interesting given that new work suggests structural colours are associated with active sexual displays and the reflection of ultraviolet light.},

However, contrary to most previous work, we also find no support for the hypotheses that high species richness is correlated with small body size and fast life history. Rather, high species diversity is strongly associated with pronounced plumage dichromatism, generalist feeding habits and good dispersal capabilities as well as large and fragmented geographical ranges. In addition, all of these relationships are robust to the removal of the two most speciose avian lineages, the Ciconiiformes and the Passeriformes. The supposed relationships between species richness and both body size and life history are, however, due to phylogenetic non- independence. Together with previous work showing that differences between avian lineages in extinction risk are associated with variation in body size and life history, these results indicate that extinction rates and speciation rates are not necessarily determined by the same factors. Hence, high extinction rates are not inevitably associated with low speciation rates. Extinction-prone. lineages may, in fact, have a high rate of speciation. In such lineages a high proportion of 'vulnerable' species would be a natural, ongoing phenomenon.},

The method takes into account information on the lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an application to the Hominoidea.},

Because phylogenies are normally inferences from data, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in estimates of the tree and its branch lengths when making inferences about ancestral states or other comparative parameters. Here we present a general Bayesian approach for testing comparative hypotheses across statistically justified samples of phylogenies, focusing on the specific issue of reconstructing ancestral states. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling phylogenetic trees and for investigating the parameters of a statistical model of trait evolution. We describe how to combine information about the uncertainty of the phylogeny with uncertainty in the estimate of the ancestral state. Our approach does not constrain the sample of trees only to those that contain the ancestral node or nodes of interest, and we show how to reconstruct ancestral states of uncertain nodes using a most-recent-common-ancestor approach. We illustrate the methods with data on ribonuclease evolution in the Artiodactyla. Software implementing the methods ( BayesMultiState) is available from the authors.},

We employ the methodology of reversible-jump ( RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly estimating the support for the hypothesis of correlated evolution. In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution. These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative evolutionary scenarios to explain the observed data. All results are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty.

Although exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal components analysis (PCA) are different techniques, PCA is often employed incorrectly to reveal latent constructs (i.e., factors) of observed variables, which is the purpose of EFA. PCA is more appropriate for reducing measured variables into a smaller set of variables (i.e., components) by keeping as much variance as possible out of the total variance in the measured variables. Furthermore, the popular use of varimax rotation raises some concerns about the relationships among the factors that researchers claim to discover. This paper discusses the distinct purposes of PCA and EFA, using two data sets as examples to highlight the differences in results between these procedures, and also reviews the use of each technique in three major communication journals: Communication Monographs, Human Communication Research, and Communication Research.},

We found significant heritability of natal dispersal distance, in both males and females, indicating substantial additive genetic variance for this behavioral trait. Natal dispersal distance additionally was affected by social and ecological factors: individuals dispersing in their first year of life moved longer distances than those staying on their natal site as helpers for a prolonged time prior to dispersal, and increasing territory isolation led to longer dispersal distances. Successful dispersers incurred fitness costs, with lifetime fledgling production (in both sexes) and lifetime production of recruits to the breeding population (in females only) decreasing with increasing natal dispersal distance. We conclude that natal dispersal distance has a genetic basis but is modulated by environmental and social factors and that natal dispersal distance in this species is (currently) under selection.},

   Abstract = {Models for the evolution of continuously varying traits use heritabilities, genetic correlations, and the G-matrix to quantify the genetic variation upon which selection acts. Given estimates of these parameters, it is possible to predict the long-term effects of selection, infer past selective forces responsible for observed differences between populations or species, and distinguish the effects of drift from selection. Application of these methods, however, requires the unproven assumption that the G-matrix remains constant from one generation to the next. This study examines the assumption of constancy for the wing pattern characteristics of two sibling species of butterflies, Precis coenia and P. evarete (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Quantitative genetic parameters were estimated from parent offspring regression. Two approaches were taken to test the null hypothesis of equality between species. First, pairwise tests between corresponding elements of G and between heritabilities and genetic correlations for the two species were constructed. Second, a modification of Bartlett's modified likelihood-ratio test was used to test for equality between the G-matrices. The matrix test failed to detect any between species differences. In contrast, pairwise comparision revealed significant differences. Thus, it appears that constancy cannot be assumed at the species level in quantitative genetic studies. In particular, the assumption of constancy was violated for the trait with the greatest difference in mean phenotype.},

   Abstract = {While the family-based analysis of genetic and environmental contributions to continuous or Gaussian traits is now straightforward using the linear mixed models approach, the corresponding analysis of complex binary traits is still rather limited. In the latter we usually rely on twin studies or pairs of relatives, but these studies often have limited sample size or have difficulties in dealing with the dependence between the pairs. Direct analysis of extended family data can potentially overcome these limitations. In this paper, we will describe various genetic models that can be analysed using an extended family structure. We use the generalized linear mixed model to deal with the family structure and likelihood-based methodology for parameter inference. The method is completely general, accommodating arbitrary family structures and incomplete data. We illustrate the methodology in great detail using the Swedish birth registry data on pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive condition induced by pregnancy. The statistical challenges include the specification of sensible models that contain a relatively large number of variance components compared to standard mixed models. In our illustration the models will account for maternal or foetal genetic effects, environmental effects, or a combination of these and we show how these effects can be readily estimated using family data.

However, there have, to our knowledge, been no tests of whether the yellow fluorescence observed under intense UVA illumination has any role in signalling. Four experiments were carried out on wild- type budgerigars, where the presence and absence of UV reflectance and fluorescence were manipulated using filters. Few studies have attempted to separate the contribution of UV reflectance to plumage hue as opposed to brightness or distinguish between a role in sexual as opposed to social preferences. However, our first experiments show that not only do females consistently prefer UV-reflecting males, but also that the observed preferences are due to removal of UV affecting the perceived hue rather than brightness. Furthermore, we found no effect Of the light environment on male response to females, suggesting that the female preferences relate to plumage colour per se. Whilst UV reflectance appears important in heterosexual choice by, females, it has no detectable influence on same-sex association preferences. The results from the second series of experiments suggest that enhancement of the budgerigar's yellow coloration through fluorescence has no effect on male attractiveness. However, the fluorescent plumage may play a role in signalling by virtue of the fact that it absorbs UVA and so increases contrast with nearby UV-reflecting plumage. Our study provides convincing evidence that UV reflectances can play a role in mate choice in non-passerines, but no evidence that the yellow fluorescence observed under UVA illumination is itself important as a signal.},

This method reduces the effective dimensionality of a multivariate data set by producing linear combinations of the original variables (i.e., components) that summarize the predominant patterns in the data. In order to provide meaningful interpretations for principal components, it is important to determine which variables are associated with particular components. Some data analysts incorrectly test the statistical significance of the correlation between original variables and multivariate scores using standard statistical tables. Others interpret eigenvector coefficients larger than an arbitrary absolute value (e.g., 0.50). Resampling, randomization techniques, and parallel analysis have been applied in a few cases. In this study, we compared the performance of a variety of approaches for assessing the significance of eigenvector coefficients in terms of type I error rates and power. Two novel approaches based on the broken-stick model were also evaluated. We used a variety of simulated scenarios to examine the influence of the number of real dimensions in the data; unique versus complex variables the magnitude of eigenvector coefficients; and the number of variables associated with a particular dimension.

Variations in these environments can be, due to variations in maternal genotypes. in our work with the intercross of two mouse inbred strains, LG/J and SM/J, we uncovered a very severe variation in maternal performance. These females failed to nurture their offspring and showed abnormal maternal behaviors. leading to loss of their litter. Rather than this being due to a single gene variant as in knockout mice, we uncovered a complex genetic basis for this trait. The effects of genes on maternal performance are entirely context dependent in our cross. They depend on the alleles present at the same or other epistatically interacting loci. Genomic locations identified in this study include locations of candidate genes whose knockouts displayed similar aberrant maternal behavior. Behaviors significantly associated with maternal performance in this study include suckling, nest building, placentophagia, pup grooming, and retrieval of pups after disturbance.},

All data sets consisted of data on 200 unrelated parents, each with 20 half-sib progenies. The accuracy of the evaluations was illustrated in terms of average bias and variation of derived correlation estimates. The average bias values generated by multiple-trait REML were generally low. In contrast, single-trait REML was sensitive to selective deletion of records and systematically underestimated the genetic correlations. For both methods, especially at low heritabilities, the magnitude of the variation was generally high, showing that there is a substantial probability of obtaining seriously misleading genetic correlation estimates if the analysis is based on a single experiment and data include non-random missing records.},

   Abstract = {Female mate choice is often based on exaggerated sexual traits, signals of male qualities that females cannot assess directly. Two such key qualities are male immune and/or sexual competence, whereby honesty in signalling could be maintained by physiological trade-offs. Carotenoid-based ornaments likely constitute such honest signals, as there is direct competition for (limited) carotenoids between ornament deposition and anti- oxidant support of immune or sperm functioning. Using spectrometry, we assessed the potential signalling function of the yellow, carotenoid-based colour of the bill of male mallards, a target of female mate choice. Here we demonstrate that bill reflectance varied with plasma carotenoid level, indicating antioxidant reserves. Moreover, lower relative UV reflectance during autumn pairing predicted immune responsiveness and correlated positively with sperm velocity during breeding, a trait that affects fertility. Our data provide support for current theories that females could use carotenoid-based sexual signals to detect immune vigour and fertilizing ability of prospective mates.},

   Abstract = {Allocation trade-offs between the immune system and sexual traits are central to current sexual selection hypotheses but remain contentious. Such trade-offs could be brought about by the dual action of testosterone that stimulates sexual signals but also suppresses immune functions and/or by competition for carotenoids that can be deposited in ornaments or used as antioxidants in support of immune functions. We investigated the trade-off between investment in immunity and maintenance of testosterone, carotenoids, and sexually selected, carotenoid- based bill color in male mallards. Following a nonpathogenic immune challenge, facultative immune investment resulted in a syndrome of changes in allocation. Plasma carotenoids disappeared from circulation proportional to antibody production. In addition, the reflectance spectrum of the bill was affected; greater antibody production was associated with an increase in relative UV reflectance. Although changes in bill reflectance and plasma carotenoids were related, the relationship appeared more complex than direct competition with immunity. Finally, maintenance of testosterone was affected by immune investment: testosterone levels declined substantially when males produced more antibodies. Because males with high testosterone are preferred by females, the decline in testosterone, in addition to carotenoid depletion and effects on bill reflectance, could constitute a significant cost of immune investment.},

In addition, previously published work by Nur (1981 et seq.) was reanalysed. 2. Specifically, the individual optimization hypothesis was evaluated: females should lay that size of clutch which maximizes the survival of their offspring. Parents with young either added to, or removed from, their nests should have lower numbers of surviving offspring that subsequently breed than control nests. 3. My own data showed that parents rearing a brood equal in number to their own original clutch-size maximized the number of surviving young: adding or removing young did not increase the number of recruits per nest. The extent to which a brood was either larger or smaller than the original clutch-size was termed 'manipulation'. A log-linear model of offspring survival showed that year effects (entered as a factor), clutch-size, manipulation and its square all significantly reduced the amount of variance (deviance) present in the data. 4. An inverse quadratic function best described the relationship between offspring survival and manipulation for each clutch- size: the turning points of these fitted lines were not significantly different from zero. 5. Reanalysis of N. Nur's data also provided support for the individual optimization hypothesis: the number of young surviving per nest was maximized when manipulation equalled zero. 6. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that females lay that size of clutch which maximizes their recruitment potential: rearing a larger or smaller brood than that which they set out to raise does not increase the fitness of individual parents.},

We assayed quantitative genetic variation in a temporary-pond-dwelling population of Daphnia pulex over a full season to examine the role of nonadditive genetic variation and genetic disequilibrium in determining the short-term evolutionary trajectory of a cyclic parthenogen. Quantitative traits were influenced by three factors: (1) clonal selection significantly changed the population mean phenotype during the course of the growing season; (2) sexual reproduction and recombination led to significant changes in life-history trait means and the levels of expressed genetic variation, implying the presence of substantial nonadditive genetic variation and genetic disequilibrium; and (3) Egg-bank effects were found to be an important component of the realized year-to-year change. Additionally, we examined the impact of genetic disequilibria induced by clonal selection on the genetic (co)variance structure with a common principal components model. Clonal selection caused significant changes in the (co)variance structure that were eliminated by a single bout of random mating, suggesting that a build-up of disequilibria was the primary source of changes in the (co)variance structure. The results of this study highlight the complexity of natural selection operating on populations that undergo alternating phases of sexual and asexual reproduction.},

   Abstract = {Theory predicts that biogeographic factors should play a central role in promoting population divergence and speciation. Previous empirical studies into biogeography and diversification have been relatively restricted in terms of the geographical area, phylogenetic scope, and the range of biogeographic factors considered. Here we present a global analysis of allopatric phenotypic divergence (measured as subspecies richness) across more than 9600 bird species. The main aim of this study was to examine the extent to which biogeographical factors can explain patterns of phenotypic divergence. Analysis of the taxonomic distribution of subspecies among species suggests that subspecies formation and extinction have occurred at a considerably faster rate than has species formation. However, the observed distribution departs from the expectation under a random birth-death model of diversification. Across 19 phylogenetic trees, we find no significant linear relationship between species age and subspecies richness, implying that species age is a poor predictor of subspecies richness. Both subspecies richness and subspecies diversification rate are found to exhibit low phylogenetic signal, meaning that closely related species do not tend to possess similar numbers of subspecies. As predicted by theory, high subspecies richness was associated with large breeding range size, island dwelling, inhabitation of montane regions, habitat heterogeneity, and low latitude. Of these factors, breeding range size was the variable that explained the most variation. Unravelling whether species that have invaded previously glacial areas have more or fewer subspecies than expected proves to be complicated due to a covariation between the postglacial colonization, latitude, geographic range size, and subspecies richness. However, the effect of postglacial colonization on subspecies richness appears to be small. Mapping the distribution of species' subspecies richness globally reveals geographical patterns that correspond to many of the predictions of the statistical models, but may also reflect geographical variation in taxonomic practice. Overall, we demonstrate that biogeographic models can explain about 30% of the global variation in subspecies richness in birds.},

   Abstract = {The comparison of additive genetic variance-covariance matrices (G-matrices) is an increasingly popular exercise in evolutionary biology because the evolution of the C-matrix is central to the issue of persistence of genetic constraints and to the use of dynamic models in an evolutionary time frame. The comparison of G-matrices is a nontrivial statistical problem because family structure induces nonindependence among the elements in each matrix. Past solutions to the problem of G- matrix comparison have dealt with this problem, with varying success, but have tested a single null hypothesis (matrix equality or matrix dissimilarity). Because matrices can differ in many ways, several hypotheses are of interest in matrix comparisons. Flury (1988) has provided an approach to matrix comparison in which a variety of hypotheses are tested, including the two extreme hypotheses prevalent in the evolutionary literature. The hypotheses are arranged in a hierarchy and involve comparisons of both the principal components (eigenvectors) and eigenvalues of the matrix. We adapt Flury's hierarchy of tests to the problem of comparing G- matrices by using randomization testing to account for nonindependence induced by family structure. Software has been developed for carrying out this analysis for both genetic and phenotypic data. The method is illustrated with a garter snake test case.},

   Abstract = {The pattern of genetic covariation among traits (the G matrix) plays a central role in determining the pattern of evolutionary change from both natural selection and random genetic drift. Here we measure the effect of genetic drift on the shape of the G matrix using a large data set on the inheritance of wing characteristics in Drosophila mellanogaster. Fifty-two inbred lines with a total of 4680 parent-offspring families were generated by one generation of brother-sister mating and compared to an outbred control population of 1945 families. In keeping with the theoretical expectation for a correlated set of additively determined traits, the average G matrix of the inbred lines remained proportional to the outbred control G matrix with a proportionality constant approximately equal to (1 - F), where F is the inbreeding coefficient. Further, the pattern of covariance among the means of the inbred lines induced by inbreeding was also proportional to the within-line G matrix of the control population with a constant very close to the expectation of 2F. Although the average G of the inbred lines did not show change in overall structure relative to the outbred controls, separate analysis revealed a great deal of variation among inbred lines around this expectation, including changes in the sign of genetic correlations. Since any given line can be quite different from the outbred control, it is likely that in nature unreplicated drift will lead to changes in the G matrix. Thus, the shape of G is malleable under genetic drift, and the evolutionary response of any particular population is likely to depend on the specifics of its evolutionary history.},

   Abstract = {Hybridization within genera occurs more frequently in avian families and subfamilies where there is considerable male parental investment, less frequently in families with moderate levels of male parental investment, and rarely in lineages where males contribute only genetic material to their offspring. In addition, genera that show considerable male parental investment are typically less speciose than genera where there is reduced male parental investment. Species showing high levels of male parental investment, however, typically have more subspecies, indicating that local adaptation evolves in these groups, but reproductive isolation does not evolve. Some hybrid matings appear to involve females of one species showing an apparent preference for mating with larger or dominant males, even if these males are heterospecific (e.g., black and mallard ducks). Similar patterns occur in fishes, amphibians, and mammals, the other three vertebrate lineages that show extensive parental care. Hybridization in birds may be an evolutionary mechanism that allows increased genetic diversity and adaptability under changing environmental conditions, particularly environments disturbed by humans. It is also possible that new forms (incipient species) may arise through hybridization that are better adapted to disturbed environments than either parental species.},

   Abstract = {Traditional models of sexual selection propose that partner choice increases both average male and average female fitness in a population. Recent theoretical and empirical work, however, has stressed that sexual conflict may be a potent broker of sexual selection. When the fitness interests of males and females diverge, a reproductive strategy that increases the fitness of one sex may decrease the fitness of the other sex. The chase-away hypothesis proposes that sexual conflict promotes sexually antagonistic, rather than mutualistic, coevolution, whereby manipulative reproductive strategies in one sex are counteracted by the evolution of resistance to such strategies in the other sex. In this paper, we consider the criteria necessary to demonstrate the chase-away hypothesis. Specifically, we review sexual conflict with particular emphasis on the chase-away hypothesis; discuss the problems associated with testing the predictions of the chase-away hypothesis and the extent to which these predictions and the predictions of traditional models of sexual selection are mutually exclusive; discuss misconceptions and mismeasures of sexual conflict; and suggest an alternative approach to demonstrate sexual conflict, measure the intensity of sexually antagonistic selection in a population, and elucidate the coevolutionary trajectories of the sexes.},

A subset of full-sib progenies produced in this cross was grown singly and in competition with the introduced grass Bromus diandrus. In a second cross, these plants were used as mothers (dams) and were each mated to the same three sires. Seeds produced by mothers competing with B. diandrus showed a significant reduction in weight, increase in time to germination, and increase in the incidence of dormancy, when compared to seeds from mothers grown singly. Significant sire components were found for time to germination and incidence of dormancy. Maternal genetic variation for seed weight was largely expressed as maternal genotype by maternal environment interaction, and showed no significant maternal genetic main effect. Time to germination and dormant fraction showed a relatively large maternal genetic effect. Evolution of seed characters in N. menziesii is more likely to occur via indirect response to selection among maternal plants than among the seeds themselves. Maternal genotype by maternal environment interaction could potentially contribute to the maintenance of maternal genetic variation in seed weight, but this does not appear likely for dormancy.},

   Abstract = {An analysis of the effects of spontaneous mutations affecting age-specific mortality was conducted using 29 lines of Drosophila melanogaster that had accumulated spontaneous mutations for 19 generations. Divergence among the lines was used to estimate the mutational variance for weekly mortality rates and the covariance between weekly mortality rates at different ages. Significant mutational variance was observed in both males and females early in life (up to similar to 30 days of age). Mutational variance was not significantly different from zero for mortality rates at older ages. Mutational correlations between ages separated by 1 or 2 wk were generally positive, but they declined monotonically with increasing separation such that mutational effects on early-age mortality were uncorrelated with effects at later ages. Analyses of individual lines revealed several instances of mutation-induced changes in mortality over a limited range of ages. Significant age-specific effects of mutations were identified in early and middle ages, but surprisingly, mortality rates at older ages were essentially unaffected by the accumulation procedure. Our-results provide strong evidence for the existence of a class of polygenic mutations that affect mortality rates on an age-specific basis. The patterns of mutational effects measured here relate directly to recently published estimates of standing genetic variance for mortality in Drosophila, and they support mutation accumulation as a viable mechanism for the evolution of senescence.},

In this study 20 male blue tits were recorded at dawn and song complexity and output were expressed as versatility, mean strophe length, mean percentage performance time and bouts with or without drift, i.e. with or without a systematic decline in percentage performance time. Females mated to males with a higher mean percentage performance time (output) and a higher versatility (complexity) started to lay eggs earlier, but the latter was not significant. Females mated to males that showed no drift in their song bouts laid significantly larger clutches. Our results thus suggest that in the blue tit, song output at dawn, rather than song complexity, might be a trait under sexual selection.},

   Abstract = {Sexual traits are usually more phenotypically variable than non-sexual traits. We show that additive genetic variation is also higher in sexual traits, and often greater than in the same, non-sexually selected trait in females or other comparable traits in the same species. In contrast there is no difference in residual variation (environmental and non- additive) or heritability. The higher genetic variability of sexual traits is contrary to the expectations of the lek paradox. This hypothesis predicts that strong sexual selection, due to female choice, leads to fixation of most genetic variation in male sexual characters. High genetic variability in sexual traits can be explained if they are subject to directional selection that is greater than linear because this selects for greater phenotypic variation. It favours modifiers that increase the number of genes and the average contribution of a locus to phenotypic variance in sexual traits. These results provide a general resolution of the lek paradox.},

   Abstract = {Understanding the capacity of natural populations to adapt to their local environment is a central topic in evolutionary biology. Phenotypic differences between populations may have a genetic basis, but showing that they reflect different adaptive optima requires the quantification of both gene flow and selection(1-3). Good empirical data are rare(4). Using data on a spatially structured island population of great tits (Parus major), we show here that a persistent difference in mean clutch size between two subpopulations only a few kilometres apart has a major genetic component. We also show that immigrants from outside the island carry genes for large clutches. But gene flow into one subpopulation is low, as a result of a low immigration rate together with strong selection against immigrant genes. This has allowed for adaptation to the island environment and the maintenance of small clutches. In the other area, however, higher gene flow prevents local adaptation and maintains larger clutches. We show that the observed small-scale genetic difference in clutch size is not due to divergent selection on the island, but to different levels of gene flow from outside the island. Our findings illustrate the large effect of immigration on the evolution of local adaptations and on genetic population structure.},

   Abstract = {Genetic variation for ecologically important traits determines the potential for evolutionary changes and should be measured directly. Such measurements of genetic variation based on quantitative genetic theory rely on assumptions of environmental constancy. These assumptions are not likely to hold in nature. Instead, natural environments are structured, and systematic variation in environmental conditions is an important determinant of phenotypic variation. Here we provide an introduction to quantitative genetics using a reaction norms approach, because we believe that this provides us with a good framework for combining ecology and genetics. We subsequently review the literature on genetic variation for clutch size of birds, and we show that, in spite of the inherent limitations of the methods employed, there is strong evidence that clutch size has a heritable component in natural populations of several species. However, the number of studies on the amount of genetic variation for clutch size in different species and across a range of environmental conditions is still far too small to study patterns in the relationship between heritable variation and properties of species and/or their environments. Furthermore, the role of both correlations and interactions with the environment in these estimates requires much more attention. Above all else, however, we need more information on the structure and magnitude of the environmental variation present in these studies. Future work should focus on how to obtain such data, and how to subsequently incorporate them into the proposed reaction norm framework. This requires the search for, and measurement of, relevant ecological variables. Also a more detailed investigation of the within-individual variation and the use of animal model methodology may prove to be valuable. Such additional data are essential for interpreting the amounts of genetic variation present for clutch size as a model system in the general problem of better understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in heterogeneous environments and the estimation of evolutionary potential.},

Following the same individual males across years yielded a trend towards adult males becoming browner the following year, while no significant differences were found in first-year males. For surviving individual males, becoming browner between successive breeding seasons was associated with relative delays in breeding phenology. Significant but not very high repeatability of male colour is found, and this trait may be subjected to moderate environmental variation, perhaps while moulting in the winter quarters. Overall, being browner may be a sign of ageing and/or poor condition in Spanish Pied Flycatchers.},

In addition to estimation of additive genetic variation by means of repeatability analyses at various ontogenetic stages and degrees of genetic resemblance, we explore in this paper variation among parent-offspring regressions between sexes and years, as well as the influence of hatching date, ectoparasite abundance, egg volume, and male and female condition on the tarsus length of their offspring. Mother-offspring regressions gave heritability estimates consistently higher than father- offspring regressions, although variation among years was large and both types of estimates yielded lower heritability values than those estimated by means of full-sib resemblance. This indicates that common environmental effects were inflating heritability estimates. There existed maternal effects via egg size, larger eggs fledging chicks with larger tarsi. Mean tarsus length of broods decreased with hatching date and, independently, with high loads of ectoparasitic, blood-feeding mites (Acari). The maternal effect via egg size persisted into the adulthood, and confounded the interpretation of differences between heritability slopes. We address the method of examining differences in parent-offspring regressions as a shorthand for estimating extra-pair copulation (EPC) rates. In our population, this method would give an EPC rate of 0-59%, depending on whether the analysis is performed with fledglings recruited to the breeding population or with offspring at the nest.},

We develop the causal relationship between metric traits and life-history traits to show that a life-history trait is expected to have a low heritability whether or not the population is at equilibrium. This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels of additive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength of genetic correlations between life- history traits, levels of nonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability of genotype-environment interaction.},

   Abstract = {I investigated genetic and environmental factors affecting fledgling chick size in the Yellow browed leaf warbler Phylloscopus inornatus. The proportion of variation among broods is > 45% for both tarsus length and body weight; this can be attributed at least in part to effects of the shared nest environment. A high offspring-parent regression for weight also appears to be partly due to an environmentally induced correlation and the regression is reduced when effects of laying date are controlled for. A cross-fostering experiment demonstrated a significant nest of origin x nest of rearing interaction. The presence of genotype-environment interaction affecting chick size may be quite general in birds. It is shown how this can account for observed patterns of the dependence of the magnitude of offspring-parent regression on prevailing conditions, as has been found in other studies. In P. inornatus the failure to detect significant genetic variance in chick body weight and tarsus length may be due to high standard errors on the estimates, but it may also reflect true low levels of genetic variance in chick size if the genotype- interaction effect described occurs regularly in this species.},

Recent comparative studies have emphasized the possible importance of such correlated responses in affecting the evolution of traits, including some behaviors, which are of little adaptive significance, or even maladaptive. However, it is also possible for traits with major effects on fitness, such as brain size, to evolve entirely by correlated response. Other traits that do not appear to have evolved at all may have been subject to much directional selection, simply to prevent their evolution by correlated response. The new interest in correlated responses reflects more rigorous attempts to consider the organism as a whole, rather than dissecting it into a number of questionably separable traits.},

The heritability estimates between cross-fostered offspring and their non-biological parents were not significantly different from zero. Likewise, the genetic correlation between male and female bill colour was large (r(g) = 0.81) for parents and their biological offspring, but not for cross-fostered offspring and their non-biological parents. I also demonstrate the extent that the genetic correlation between the sexes can retard the predicted evolution of bill colour and create a selection load that reduces the expected reproduction of this laboratory population.},

   Abstract = {Patterns of melanin pigmentation in birds are extremely varied. Nevertheless it is easy to think of many patterns that are never observed, and others that frequently recur in diverse and distantly related species. Using as our model the avian genus Phylloscopus we ask how the restricted range of observed patterns might be attributable to a restricted range of variants produced by developmental perturbations. The patterns we consider consist of unmelanized patches on the wings, crown and rump on otherwise pigmented upperparts. We use reaction- diffusion models to show that gross features of the pattern can be simply predicted from considerations of embryo shape. We suggest that birds are expected to have more patterned heads, because the head region is relatively larger than other regions in the developing embryo. A comparative analysis across many species of birds and a phylogenetic analysis within the genus Phylloscopus show that the component elements of the pattern have repeatedly been lost and gained during evolution. A shift in a threshold reading could explain the appearance and disappearance of the unmelanized patches, perhaps through changes in the sensitivity of melanocytes to epidermal signals. Such threshold shifts would make the transition between patterned and unpatterned forms particularly easy once the patterns have been exposed to selection in some distant ancestor. This partitioning of the roles of selection and development implies that many features of the patterns reflect developmental mechanisms in both immediate and more distant ancestors.},

   Abstract = {The role of sexual selection in speciation is investigated, addressing two main issues. First, how do sexually selected traits become species recognition traits? Theory and empirical evidence suggest that female preferences often do not evolve as a correlated response to evolution of male traits. This implies that, contrary to runaway (Fisherian) models of sexual selection, premating isolation will not arise as an automatic side effect of divergence between populations in sexually selected traits. I evaluate premating isolating mechanisms in one group, the birds. In this group premating isolation is often a consequence of sexual imprinting, whereby young birds learn features of their parents and use these features in mate choice. Song, morphology and plumage are known recognition cues. I conclude that perhaps the main role for sexual selection in speciation is in generating differences between populations in traits. Sexual imprinting then leads to these traits being used as species recognition mechanisms. The second issue addressed in this paper is the role of sexual selection in adaptive radiation, again concentrating on birds. Ecological differences between species include large differences in size, which may in themselves be sufficient for species recognition, and differences in habitat, which seem to evolve frequently and at all stages of an adaptive radiation. Differences in habitat often cause song and plumage patterns to evolve as a result of sexual selection for efficient communication. Therefore sexual selection is likely to have an important role in generating premating isolating mechanisms throughout an adaptive radiation. It is also possible that sexual selection, by creating more allopatric species, creates more opportunity for ecological divergence to occur. The limited available evidence does not support this idea. A role for sexual selection in accelerating ecological diversification has yet to be demonstrated.},

Our purposes were to assess the role of intrinsic F, hybrid infertility and inviability in the speciation process, and to compare rates of loss of fertility and viability between the sexes. Among our sample more than half the crosses between species in the same genus produce fertile hybrids. Complete loss of F-1 hybrid fertility takes on the order of millions of years. Loss of F-1 hybrid viability occurs over longer timescales than fertility: some viable hybrids have been produced between taxa that appear to have been separated for more than 55 my. There is strong support for Haldane's rule, with very few examples where the male has lower fitness than the female., However; in contrast to Drosophila, fertility of the homogametic sex in the F-1 appears to be lost before viability of the heterogametic sex in the F-1. We conclude that the time span of loss of intrinsic hybrid fertility and viability is often, but not always, longer than the time to speciation. Premating isolation is an important mechanism maintaining reproductive isolation in birds. In addition, other factors causing postzygotic reproductive isolation such as ecological causes of hybrid unfitness, reduced mating success of hybrids, and genetic incompatibilities in the F(2)s and backcrosses may often be involved in the speciation process.},

These results indicate that the spongy medullary keratin is a nanostructured tissue that functions as an array of coherent scatterers. The nanostructure of the medullary keratin is nearly uniform in all directions. The largest Fourier components of spatial variation in refractive index in the tissue are of the appropriate size to produce the observed colours by constructive interference alone. The peaks of the predicted reflectance spectra calculated from the 2D Fourier power spectra are congruent with the reflectance spectra measured by using microspectrophotometry. The alternative physical models for the production of these colours, the Rayleigh and Mie theories, hypothesize that medullary keratin is an incoherent array and that scattered waves are independent in phase. This assumption is falsified by the ring-like Fourier power spectra of these feathers, and the spacing of the scattering air vacuoles in the medullary keratin. Structural colours of avian feather barbs are produced by constructive interference of coherently scattered light waves from the optically heterogeneous matrix of keratin and air in the spongy medullary layer.},

We investigated the colour, anatomy, nanostructure and biophysics of structurally coloured skin, ramphotheca and podotheca from 31 species of birds from 17 families in 10 orders from across Aves. Integumentary structural colours of birds include ultraviolet, dark blue, light blue, green and yellow hues. The discrete peaks in reflectance spectra do not conform to the inverse fourth power relationship predicted by Rayleigh scattering. The dermis of structurally coloured skin consists of a thick (100-500 mum) layer of collagen that is usually underlain by a layer of melanin granules. Transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) of this colour-producing dermal collagen layer revealed quasi-ordered arrays of parallel collagen fibres. Two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis of TEMs of the collagen arrays revealed a ring of peak spatial frequencies in the spatial variation in refractive index that are the appropriate size to make the observed ultraviolet-yellow colours by coherent scattering alone. One species, Philepitta castanea (Eurylaimidae), has exceptionally ordered, hexagonal arrays of collagen fibres that produce a hexagonal pattern of spatial frequency peaks in the power spectra. Ultraviolet, blue, green and yellow structural colours of avian skin are produced by coherent scattering (i.e. constructive interference) by arrays of collagen fibres in the dermis. Some yellow and orange skin colours are produced with a combination of structural and pigmentary mechanisms. These combined colours can have reflectance spectra with discrete peaks that are more saturated than hues produced by carotenoid pigments alone. Bluish facial skin from two species of Neotropical antbirds (Thamnophilidae) are nanostructurally too small to produce visible light by coherent scattering, and the colour production mechanism in these species remains unknown. Based on the phylogenetic distribution of structurally coloured skin in Aves, this mechanism of colour production has evolved convergently more than 50 independent times within extant birds.},

   Abstract = {Carotenoid colour displays are widely assumed to be honest indicators of individual health or quality, primarily in mate attraction. Here we show that sexually dimorphic carotenoid ornamentation functions as an agonistic signal in male red- collared widowbirds, Euplectes ardens. Mounted mate models differing (within natural limits) in the intensity of carotenoid signalling were presented to wild resident males as simulated intruders, perched or made to 'fly' across the territory with the elongated tail folded or keeled. Perched mounts were generally ignored, and stronger aggression towards 'flying' models with a keeled tail (i.e. as in courtship display) than a folded tail suggests the tail display is used to assess the intention of intruding males. Territory owners were less aggressive towards models with intense collar display, suggesting that carotenoid coloration functions as a badge of status in this species. The level of aggressive response was also related to the resident's own badge in that males with larger, redder collars responded more aggressively to the models. In addition, males with a larger collar signal defended larger territories and spent less time in territory defence. Apart from the collar size and 'redness', no other morphological variable predicted the aggressive response of territorial males. Given the previously demonstrated insignificance of the collar in female mate choice, we suggest that the nuptial carotenoid coloration is an honest signal of dominance or fighting ability, sexually selected through male contest competition over territories.

   Number = {7},
   Pages = {1452-1463},
   Abstract = {Although sexual selection through female choice explains exaggerated male ornaments in many species, the evolution of the multicomponent nature of most sexual displays remains poorly understood. Theoretical models suggest that handicap signaling should converge on a single most informative quality indicator, whereas additional signals are more likely to be arbitrary Fisherian traits, amplifiers, or exploitations of receiver psychology. Male nuptial plumage in the highly polygynous red-collared widowbird (Euplectes ardens) comprises two of the commonly advocated quality advertisements (handicaps) in birds: a long graduated tail and red carotenoid coloration. Here we use multivariate selection analysis to investigate female choice in relation to male tail length, color (reflectance) of the collar, other aspects of morphology, ectoparasite load, display rate, and territory quality. The order and total number of active nests obtained are used as measures of male reproductive success. We demonstrate a strong female preference and net sexual selection for long tails, but marginal or no effects of color, morphology, or territory quality. Tail length explained 47% of male reproductive success, an unusually strong fitness effect of natural ornament variation. Fluctuating tail asymmetry was unrelated to tail length, and had no impact on mating success. For the red collar, there was negative net selection on collar area, presumably via its negative relationship with tail length. None of the color variables (hue, chroma, and brightness) had significant selection differentials, but a partial effect (selection gradient) of chroma might represent a color preference when tail length is controlled for. We suggest that the red collar functions in male agonistic interactions, which has been strongly supported by subsequent work. Thus, female choice targets only one handicap, extreme tail elongation, disregarding or even selecting against the carotenoid display. We discuss whether long tails might be better indicators of genetic quality than carotenoid pigmentation. As regards the evolution of multiple ornaments, we propose that multiple handicap signaling is stable not because of multiple messages but because of multiple receivers, in this case females and males.},

   Abstract = {Carotenoid-based plumage ornaments are typically considered to be sexually selected traits, functioning as honest condition- dependent signals of phenotypic quality, but few studies have addressed the function of carotenoid color variation in male contest competition. Using two experiments, we investigated the status signaling function of the variable (ranging from yellow to red) carotenoid throat patch (collar) in the polygynous, sexually dimorphic red-collared widowbird (Euplectes ardens). First, we tested if the red collar functions as a dominance signal by painting spectrometrically controlled collar patches onto the brown plumage of nonbreeding males and staging dyadic male contests over food resources. Red-collared males dominated orange males, which in turn dominated the control brown and novel blue collars. Red dominance persisted when the collar manipulations were reversed within dyads and also when tested against testosterone implanted males. In the second experiment the collar size and color of breeding males were manipulated in the field before and after territories were established. All males with enlarged red and most with enlarged orange or reduced red collars obtained territories, whereas most males with reduced orange and all with blackened (removed) collars failed to establish or retain territories. In addition, among the territorial males, those with reduced signals defended smaller territories, received more intrusions, and spent more time in aggressive interactions. Redness and, to a lesser extent, size of the carotenoid ornament both seem to independently indicate male dominance status or fighting ability in male contest competition.},

Here, we experimentally tested the relative importance of a genetic colour polymorphism in determining male dominance in the Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), a species displaying three completely discrete but naturally co-occurring genetically inherited phenotypes,- yellow-, red- (carotenoid) and black-headed (melanin) morphs. First, in staged dominance contests between unfamiliar birds of different head morphs, red-headed males dominated black-headed males, both of which dominated the yellow-headed birds. Second, within morphs, the intensity and size of the strongly ultraviolet-blue collar determined the outcome of these contests, and among the red-headed males, redder males dominated less chromatic birds. Lastly, when the dominance signal of red-headed birds was experimentally destabilized (i.e. blackened or reddened), naturally red-headed morphs continued to dominate both the black-and yellow-headed morphs. Together, these results suggest that intrinsic dominance-related behavioural differences between the three colour morphs, which are likely to influence the relative fitness of each morph, contribute to the complex selective patterns maintaining these three discrete phenotypes in relatively stable frequencies in wild populations.},

Here we explore how data depth (number of years) and completeness (number of observations) influence estimates of genetic variance and covariance within the context of an existing pedigree. Using long-term data from the great tit Parus major and the mute swan Cygnus olor, species with different life-histories, we examined the effect of manipulating the amount of data included on quantitative genetic parameter estimates. Manipulating data depth and completeness had little influence on estimated genetic variances, heritabilities, or genetic correlations, but (as expected) did influence confidence in these estimates. Estimated breeding values in the great tit were not influenced by data depth but were in the mute swan, probably because of differences in pedigree structure. Our analyses suggest the 'rule of thumb' that data from 3 years and a minimum of 100 individuals per year are needed to estimate genetic parameters with acceptable confidence, and that using pedigree data is worthwhile, even if phenotypes are only available toward the tips of the pedigree.},

   Abstract = {Most studies of variation in male reproductive tactics have focused on conspicuous categorical differences in mating behaviour (i.e. variation in mating strategies). However, in the presence of trade-offs between investment in competition over matings, parental care and survival, a. male's optimal allocation rule might vary according to his physiological condition and social or ecological environment. Thus, there may also be more subtle variation in male reproductive tactics. Here, I show that the reproductive effort (estimated as residual change in condition) of male collared flycatchers was affected by the size of their forehead patch (a secondary sexual character), age and date of arrival at the breeding grounds. Among early males (i.e. males with a high likelihood of both attracting more than one female and obtaining extra- pair copulations), large-patched males made a relatively large reproductive effort and as a result were in worse condition at the time of feeding offspring as compared to small-patched males. Furthermore, among early breeders, young males and males with experimentally increased forehead patch size made a relatively high effort. By contrast, regardless of age and badge size, there were no such patterns observed among late breeders. These results suggest that collared flycatchers use different reproductive tactics depending on both internal and external factors, and that the size of a secondary sexual trait may not only indicate variation in individual condition but also predict how resources will be allocated between pre- and post-mating reproductive activities.},

In this study, I investigated whether the estimated heritability of a condition-dependent secondary sexual character (i.e., the white forehead badge) in the collared flycatcher varied depending on environmental conditions experienced during offspring growth. The data were collected over a period of 14 years making it possible to exploit natural variation in natal conditions. In addition, natal conditions were experimentally altered through brood size manipulations. During unfavorable conditions caused by generally poor weather or experimentally enlarged brood size, no significant heritability based on father-sons regressions could be demonstrated (0.19 less than or equal to h(2) less than or equal to 0.27). In contrast, sons reared during years with favorable weather or in experimentally reduced broods significantly resembled their fathers (0.44 less than or equal to h(2) less than or equal to 0.65). In addition, the heritability estimates declined with increasing maternal age. The strong effect of natal environmental condition on the estimated heritability of forehead badge size suggests that the potential genetic benefit from mate choice vary according to environmental conditions (e.g., the benefit is reduced during unfavorable rearing conditions). Because sons reared during poor conditions have probably experienced a natal environment different from that experienced by their fathers, the low heritability estimates obtained under poor conditions seem to be caused by low additive genetic variation expressed in such environments and/or a low genetic correlation between the expression of the trait in the two different environments (i.e., good vs. bad). Both of these explanations imply the presence of genotype-by-environment interactions. If such interactions frequently affect the expression of secondary sexual characters, this may offer an explanation of the high heritabilites sometimes reported for such traits, despite their exposure to long-term directional selection.},

Here we show experimentally that the preference of female collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis for male forehead patch size, a sexually selected trait(4-6), varies with the time of breeding, an environmental factor with strong effects on reproductive success. Contrary to expectations based on time-constrained choice models(7,8), only late-breeding females prefer males with a large patch size. The variation in mate preference matches a seasonal change in female reproductive success: longterm data reveal a positive relationship between female reproductive success and male patch size exclusively in late breeders. In addition, female reproductive effort, as assessed by clutch size, appears to be adjusted relative to both timing of breeding and male phenotype. We conclude that not only can mate preferences display adaptive plasticity within populations, but this plasticity can also be linked to differences in reproductive investment.},

Individual variation in such male abilities may override the costs of polygyny and therefore largely explain within- population variation in mating patterns. We investigated the influence of variation in male ornamentation and the environment on the costs of polygyny for female collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis), using data from a long-term study involving 2733 breeding attempts over 19 years. We show that females stiffer reduced reproductive success when mated polygynously but that the costs of polygyny depend on air interaction between male ornamentation and timing of breeding. Among early breeders, polygynously mated females experience higher reproductive Success when mated to less ornamented males, but among late breeders, females mated polygnously to highly ornamented males were more successful. We suggest that a high effort spent on obtaining extrapair matings early in the season renders highly ornamented males less able to assist two females in caring for the young. Thus, a male's ability to simultaneously gain from extrapair matings and polygyny may be limited through direct effects on female reproductive success. Given such limitation, extrapair matings may be expected to be less frequent in species with biparental care and a high level of social polygyny.},

   Abstract = {What is the form of natural selection on immune responsiveness? For a population at evolutionary equilibrium, there are two different scenarios. First, it is generally assumed that immune defense has both benefits and costs. If variation in immune responsiveness is due to variation in how individuals trade off these costs and benefits, one would expect immune responsiveness to be subject to stabilizing selection. Second, it is well known that an individual's immune responsiveness is often dependent on its overall condition. If immune responsiveness is condition-dependent, one would expect immune responsiveness to be under positive directional selection. We would therefore expect that the form of natural selection on immune responsiveness depends on the relative magnitude of these two sources of variation: variation in how individuals trade off the costs and benefits of defense, and variation in condition. We measured primary and secondary antibody responsiveness to diphtheria-tetanus vaccine in blue tits during winter and investigated the relationship between responsiveness and survival to the following breeding season. We use responsiveness to these antigens as measures of an individual's ability or propensity to mount an antibody response in case of an infection. Interestingly, different measures of responsiveness were subject to different selective regimes: primary responsiveness to diphtheria was subject to stabilizing selection, whereas secondary responsiveness to tetanus was subject to positive directional selection. In contrast, there was no significant selection on primary responsiveness to tetanus or secondary responsiveness to diphtheria. The finding of stabilizing selection on a measure of responsiveness is evidence that immune defense can incur fitness costs; a central but little-tested assumption of theories of the ecology and evolution of immunological defense. The finding of directional selection on a measure of responsiveness is consistent with the idea that immune responsiveness is condition-dependent, although we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that the population is not at evolutionary equilibrium with respect to this trait.},

   Abstract = {The size of an organism at any point during ontogeny often has fitness consequences through either direct selection on size or through selection on size-related morphological, performance, or life history traits. However, the evolutionary response to selection on size across ontogeny ( a growth trajectory) may be limited by genetic correlations across ages. Here we characterize the phenotypic and genetic covariance structure of length and mass growth trajectories in a natural population of larval Ambystoma macrodactylum using function-valued quantitative genetic analyses and principal component decomposition. Most of the phenotypic and genetic variation in both growth trajectories appears to be confined to a single principal component describing a pattern of positive covariation among sizes across all ages. Higher order principal components with no significant associated genetic variation were identified for both trajectories, suggesting that evolution towards certain patterns of negative covariation between sizes across ages is constrained. The well- characterized positive relationship between size at metamorphosis and fitness in pond-breeding amphibians predicts that the across-age covariance structure will strongly limit evolution only if there is negative selection on size prior to metamorphosis. The pattern of genetic covariation observed in this study is similar to that observed in other vertebrate taxa, indicating that size may often be highly genetically and phenotypically integrated across ontogeny. Additionally, we find that phenotypic and genetic analyses of growth trajectories can yield qualitatively similar patterns of covariance structure.},

However, the birds in these studies may have been interpreting a staged predation event as a period when they were unable to feed rather than a change in predation risk: theory predicts that, if the food supply within the environment is variable, then reserves should be increased. In the present study, we presented blue tits (Parus caeruleus) with a potential predator and compared this response (which could have been potentially confounded by perceived interruption effects) with a response to an actual interruption in the environment during both long and short daytime lengths. During long (but not short) days, the birds responded in line with theoretical predictions by increasing their reserves in response to interruption and reducing them in response to predation.

This report demonstrates that the phenotypic covariance between fitness and a trait, used as an estimate of the selection differential in estimating selection gradients, has two components: a component induced by selection itself and a component due to the effect of environmental factors on fitness. The second component is shown to be responsible for biases in estimates of selection gradients. The use of regressions involving genotypic and breeding values instead of phenotypic values can yield estimates of selection gradients that are not biased by environmental covariances. Statistical methods for estimating the coefficients of such regressions, and for testing for biases in regressions involving phenotypic values, are described.},

For animals from natural populations empirical estimates of IGE are sparse. Thus, despite recent models relating IGE to evolution, evolutionary interpretations of IGE are limited. To address this deficit, we used a reciprocal cross-fostering breeding design to estimate environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects, and direct-indirect genetic covariances in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus to determine the evolutionary importance of IGE arising from variation in parental care performance. Carrion size positively affected adult mass and time on carrion, but had no effect on total development time. Males were slightly larger than females. For both mass and development, independent of these environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects were of moderate magnitude. Total genetic effects explained 36- 50% of the phenotypic variance in mass and size and 27-37% of phenotypic variance in development time. Direct-indirect genetic covariances were zero or close to zero. Thus, for both mass and development time, the response to natural selection arising from environmental variation may be accelerated by the presence of IGE in N. pustulatus . The generality of this pattern and the evolutionary significance of IGE arising from parental care awaits further study of natural populations.},

   Abstract = {Despite a growing interest in the evolutionary aspects of maternal effects, few studies have examined the genetic consequences of maternal effects associated with parental care, To begin to provide data on nonlaboratory or nondomestic animals. we compared the effect of presence and absence of parental care on phenotype expression of larval mass and development time at different life-history stages in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus. This beetle has facultative cared parents can feed their larvae through regurgitation or digested carrion or offspring can reed by themselves from previously prepared carrion. To investigate larval responses to these two levels of care, including estimates of additive genetic effects, maternal effects, and genotype-by-environment interactions, we used a half-sibling split-family breeding experiment-raising half of the offspring, of a family in the presence of their mother and the other hair without their mother present, Larvae reared with their mother present were on average headier and developed faster, although some of the difference in development decreased or were eliminated by the adult stage. These results suggest that presence or absence of post-hatching maternal care plays an important role in phenotype expression early in life, whereas later the phenotype of the offspring is determined mainly by the genotype and/or unshared environmental effects. Our study also permitted Lis to examine the differences in genetic effects between the two care environments. Heritabilities, maternal/common environment effect, and most genetic correlations did not differ between the care treatments. Genetic analyses revealed substantial additive genetic effects For development time but small effects for measures of body mass. Maternal Plus common environment effects were high for measure,, of mass hut low for development time. suggesting that indirect genetic effects or maternal and/or common environment are less important for the evolution of development time than for mass. Estimates of genetic correlations revealed a trade- off between the duration of the two development stages after the offspring left the carrion. There also a negative genetic correlation between the time spent on carrion and the mass at 72 h, when mothers usually feeding. The analysis of genotype- by-environment interactions indicates substantial among maternal families in response to care. Presence or absence of parental care may therefore contribute to the additive genetic variance through its interaction,with the maternal component of the additive genetic variance. The presence of this interaction further suggests that parent may vary in care strategies, with some parents dispersing after preparation of the carrion and some parents staving with the larvae. This interaction may help maintain genetic variation in growth, development time, and parental care behavior. Additional work is needed, however, to quantify indirect genetic effects, and genetic variation in parental care behavior itself.},

For example, song repertoires are larger in species where males provide more parental care; syllable repertoire sizes are greater in polygynous species; migrants have larger song and syllable repertoires; and more vocalization during a song bout is associated with higher fecundities and lower metabolic rates. These associations often differ at different taxonomic levels, suggesting that the factors causing divergence in song characters within genera are different from those responsible for divergence among more distantly related taxa. In general, correlates of greater song complexity can be interpreted as those factors likely to produce more intense inter- or intra-sexual selection (polygyny, migration, paternal care). Measures of song output are correlated with factors likely to be associated with species differences in energetic requirements (metabolic rate) or reproductive effort (fecundity). The ecological and behavioural correlates of within-song complexity differ from those of between-song complexity, suggesting that they are not alternative solutions to the same selective pressures.},

We included adult mass in our analyses because it is related to several life-history traits. We used the mother- daughter regression method and resampling tests based on data from long-term monitoring of marked females. Contrary to the theoretical prediction of low heritability for fitness-related traits, heritability estimates in the Ram Mountain population ranged from 0.02 to 0.81 (mean of 0.52), and several were different from zero. Coefficients of variation tend to support the hypothesis of a higher environmental influence on life- history traits. In contrast, at Sheep River we found low heritabilities of life-history traits. Phenotypic correlations Varied between -0.09 and 0.95. Several genetic correlations were strong, particularly for different reproductive traits that are functionally related, and ranged from -0.34 to 1.71. Overall, genetic and phenotypic correlations between the same variables were similar in magnitude and direction. We found no phenotypic or genetic correlations suggesting trade-offs among life-history traits. Bighorn sheep may not form the large, outbred populations at equilibrium that are assumed by both Fisher's fundamental theorem and by theories predicting antagonistic pleiotropy between life-history traits. Alternatively, the absence of negative genetic correlations may result from genetic variation in ability to acquire resources or from novel environmental conditions existing during the study period.},

Longitudinal analysis of females breeding in multiple years suggests that much of this change in parturition date can be explained by a plastic response to increased food abundance (3.7 days per generation). Significant changes in breeding values (0.8 days per generation), were in concordance with predictions from the breeder's equation (0.6 days per generation), and indicated that an evolutionary response to strong selection favouring earlier breeders also contributed to the observed advancement of this heritable trait. The timing of breeding in this population of squirrels, therefore, has advanced as a result of both phenotypic changes within generations, and genetic changes among generations in response to a rapidly changing environment.},

Litter size at birth and parturition date had low heritabilities (h(2) = 0.15 and 0.16, respectively). We considered potential effects of temporal environmental covariances between phenotypes and fitness and of spatial environmental heterogeneity in estimates of selection. Selection favored early breeders and females that produced litter sizes close to the population average.

Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between the two measures for life-history traits (r = -0.11) or for the quantitative measure generally considered as the best indicator of adaptive potential, heritability (r = -0.08). Consequently, molecular measures of genetic diversity have only a very limited ability to predict quantitative genetic variability.

Thorax width was used as an estimator of body size. Selection was maintained for 21 generations in both directions on males only, females only, or both sexes simultaneously. The correlated response of sexual size dimorphism in each selection regime was compared to the response predicted by four variants of the model, each of which differed only in assumptions about input parameters. Body size responded well to selection, but the correlated response of sexual size dimorphism was weaker than that predicted by any of the variants. Dimorphism decreased in most selection lines, contrary to the model predictions. We suggest that selection on body size acts primarily on growth trajectories. Changes in dimorphism are caused by the fact that male and female growth trajectories are not parallel and termination of growth at different points along the curves results in dimorphism levels that are difficult to predict without detailed knowledge of growth parameters. This may also explain many of the inconsistent results in dimorphism changes seen in earlier selection experiments.},

   Abstract = {The reasons why growth and developmental rates vary widely among species have remained unclear. Previous examinations of possible environmental influences on growth rates of birds yielded few correlations, leading to suggestions that young may be growing at maximum rates allowed within physiological constraints. However, estimations of growth rates can be confounded by variation in relative developmental stage at fledging. Here, we re-estimate growth rates to control for developmental stage. We used these data to examine the potential covariation of growth and development with environmental variation across a sample of 115 North American passerines. Contrary to previous results, we found that growth rates of altricial nestlings were strongly positively correlated to daily nest predation rates, even after controlling for adult body mass and phylogeny. In addition, nestlings of species under stronger predation pressure remained in the nest for a shorter period, and they left the nest at lower body mass relative to adult body mass. Thus, nestlings both grew faster and left the nest at an earlier developmental stage in species with higher risk of predation. Growth patterns were also related to food, clutch size, and latitude. These results support a view that growth and developmental rates of altricial nestlings are strongly influenced by the environmental conditions experienced by species, and they generally lend support to an adaptive view of interspecific variation in growth and developmental rates.},

   Abstract = {Sibling competition was proposed as an important selective agent in the evolution of growth and development. Brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) intensifies sibling competition in the nests of its hosts by increasing host chick mortality and exposing them to a genetically unrelated nestmate. Intranest sibling competition for resources supplied by parents is size dependent. Thus, it should select for high development rates and short nestling periods, which would alleviate negative impacts of brood parasitic chicks on host young. I tested these predictions on 134 North American passerines by comparative analyses. After controlling for covariates and phylogeny, I showed that high parasitism rate was associated with higher nestling growth rate, lower mass at fledging, and shorter nestling periods. These effects were most pronounced in species in which sibling competition is most intense (i.e., weighing over about 30 g). When species were categorized as nonhosts versus old hosts (parasitized for thousands of years) versus new hosts (parasitized the last 100-200 years), there was a clear effect of this parasitism category on growth strategies. Nestling growth rate was the most evolutionarily flexible trait, followed by mass at fledging and nestling period duration. Adjustments during incubation (incubation period length, egg volume) were less pronounced and generally disappeared after controlling for phylogeny. I show that sibling competition caused by brood parasites can have strong effects on the evolution of host growth strategies and that the evolution of developmental traits can take place very rapidly. Human alteration of habitats causing spread of brood parasites to new areas thus cascades into affecting the evolution of life-history traits in host species.},

Juveniles of birds under strong nest predation pressure grow rapidly, have short incubation and nestling periods, and leave the nest at low body mass. Life-history theory predicts that parental investment increases with adult mortality rate. Thus, developmental traits that depend on the parental effort exerted (pre- and postnatal growth rate) should scale positively with adult mortality, in contrast to those that do not have a direct relationship with parental investment (timing of developmental events, e.g. nest leaving). I tested this prediction on a sample of 84 North American songbirds. Nestling growth rate scaled positively and incubation period duration negatively with annual adult mortality rates even when controlled for nest predation and other covariates, including phylogeny. On the contrary, neither the duration of the nestling period nor body mass at fledging showed any relationship. Proximate mechanisms generating the relationship of pre- and postnatal growth rates to adult mortality may include increased feeding, nest attentiveness during incubation and/or allocation of hormones, and deserve further attention.},

Males were smaller in all traits except fore femur width. Heritabilities of morphological traits ranged from 0.33 to 0.90 and tended to be higher than the average reported for ectotherms (Mousseau and Roff, 1987). Those for the three female life history traits estimated were lower (0.16-0.32) and about average. Genetic correlations between the sexes ranged from 0.52 to 0.87 and were all less than unity. Differential selection on morphology in males and females can thus be expected to produce fast evolutionary responses in this species. Our analysis revealed also that in S, cynipsea phenotypic correlations are good substitutes for genetic correlations for combinations involving morphological traits, and that genetic correlations derived from the ANCOVA and the family mean methods were very similar. However, the former correspondence may be strongly reduced by the inclusion of particular traits (here male seta length).},

This sort of change must occur in both the evolution of canalization, in which a character becomes increasingly buffered against genetic or developmental variation, and in the phenomenon of closely related species that show similar adult phenotypes but different underlying developmental patterns. To study such phenomena, I develop a model that follows evolution on a surface representing adult phenotype as a function of underlying developmental characters. A contour on such a "phenotype landscape" is a set of states of developmental characters that produce the same adult phenotype. Epistasis induces curvature of this surface, and degree of canalization is represented by the slope along a contour. I first discuss the geometric properties of phenotype landscapes, relating epistasis to canalization. I then impose a fitness function on the phenotype and model evolution of developmental characters as a function of the fitness function and the local geometry of the surface. This model shows how canalization evolves as a population approaches an optimum phenotype. It further shows that under some circumstances, "decanalization" can occur, in which the expression of adult phenotype becomes increasingly sensitive to developmental variation. This process can cause very similar populations to diverge from one another developmentally even when their adult phenotypes experience identical selection regimes.},

Direct breeding benefits were found to be significantly higher than indirect kin benefits for both female and male subordinates. As predicted, female subordinates gained significantly more direct breeding opportunities and therefore higher inclusive fitness benefits by being a subordinate within a group than did males. This may explain why most subordinates in the Seychelles warbler are female.},

Although genetic variation was higher in the GRW, considerable variation has been maintained in the SW. The ten exon 3 sequences found in the SW were as diverged from each other as were a random sub- sample of the 67 sequences from the GRW. There was evidence for balancing selection in both species, and the phylogenetic analysis showing that the exon 3 sequences did not separate according to species, was consistent with transspecies evolution of the MHC.},

Female subordinates that helped were significantly more related to the nestlings than were nonhelpers, and the decision to help appears to be based on associative learning cues. High levels of female infidelity means that subordinates cannot trust their legitimacy through the male line, consequently they appear to use the continued presence of the primary female, but not the primary male, as a reliable cue to determine when to feed nestlings. By using effective discrimination, female subordinates are able to maximize the indirect benefits gained within. a cooperative breeding system otherwise driven primarily by direct breeding benefits.},

   Abstract = {1. A major challenge for population ecology is to predict population responses to novel conditions, such as habitat loss. This frequently involves understanding dispersal decisions, in terms of their consequences for fitness. However, this approach requires detailed data, and is thus often inappropriate for urgent problems on poorly known species. This may be resolved by developing a predictive framework based on well-studied species, for applying to those that are less well understood. 2. Population size, group sizes and habitat occupancy of the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis ) can be predicted by determining the evolutionary stable dispersal strategy. For densities near to demographic equilibrium, regulation results from the combined effects of non-breeding and use of sink habitats. 3. In the Seychelles warbler, resident male non-breeders compete for breeding vacancies on neighbouring territories. The resulting kin competition is a key process for predicting the observed balance between regulation by non-breeding and regulation by sink use. Family groups, in which offspring delay dispersal, hoping to fill a vacancy on a local territory, are common among group-living species. This suggests that kin competition may frequently play a central role in the population regulation of socially complex species. 4. Although all the model variants considered are complex, predictions are shown to be insensitive to a range of simplifications, illustrating that, despite significant evolutionary import at the individual level, some behaviour can be unimportant when considering population level questions. Identifying which behavioural strategies have significant demographic consequences is key to the further development of population models based on fitness maximizing behaviour.},

We restore a kin-competition effect on emigration rates from dominance-ranked family groups by showing that where siblings form queues to inherit the breeding positions, the length of the queue affects the fitness of all individuals by depreciating the rank of subsequent offspring. Incorporating this 'offspring depreciation' effect decreases optimal queue lengths, increases dispersal rates and explains the otherwise paradoxical use of sinks by cooperatively breeding birds in stable environments. The offspring depreciation effect also favours the evolution of small, but consistent, clutch sizes and high reproductive skew, but constrains the evolution of alloparenting.},

We show that the population dynamics of an island population of Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) cannot be modelled with an ideal despotic distribution, and suggest the effects of both territory shrinkage and territorial disputes on reproductive success must be included to adequately model the population dynamics of this species. To do this we introduce two different approaches. The first is reductionist, using data on how population density affects individuals' reproductive success to predict population growth rates. Because such a model is mechanistic, it can be used to predict population dynamics in novel environments, making it a desirable long-term solution. However, because territorial populations are typically tightly regulated, birth and death rate data at low population densities are often unavailable. Hence, our second approach statistically infers the relationship between population density and per territory reproductive success, and thus provides a stop-gap solution for the shorter term. Our analysis indicates that although the Cousin population of Seychelles warblers is highly resilient to environmental stochasticity, the degree of resilience is considerably underestimated by approaches that ignore intrinsic regulation through territory shrinkage and territorial disputes.},

Among experimental treatments, the high-quality parents had a significantly higher chick survival rate than low-quality parents in 1991 and when data from 1990 and 1991 were pooled. A positive effect of egg size on chick survival was apparent only when data from both years were pooled. Chicks raised by high-quality parents had higher structural growth rates (tarsus) than chicks raised by low-quality parents. We discount the likelihood for selection of larger eggs because egg size has trade-offs with other life- history traits that have a strong influence on fitness. Despite the correlation between parental quality and chick survival, we doubt that there is character displacement for greater parental quality. Parental quality is probably affected by nutrition and is expected to have low heritability.},

   Abstract = {A marker-based method for studying quantitative genetic characters in natural populations is presented and evaluated. The method involves regressing quantitative trait similarity on marker-estimated relatedness between individuals. A procedure is first given for estimating the narrow sense heritability and additive genetic correlations among traits, incorporating shared environments. Estimation of the actual variance of relatedness is required for heritability, but not for genetic correlations. The approach is then extended to include isolation by distance of environments, dominance, and shared levels of inbreeding. Investigations of statistical properties show that good estimates do not require great marker polymorphism, but rather require significant variation of actual relatedness; optimal allocation generally favors sampling many individuals at the expense of assaying fewer marker loci; when relatedness declines with physical distance, it is optimal to restrict comparisons to within a certain distance; the power to estimate shared environments and inbreeding effects is reasonable, but estimates of dominance variance may be difficult under certain patterns of relationship; and any linkage of markers to quantitative trait loci does not cause significant problems. This marker-based method makes possible studies with long-lived organisms or with organisms difficult to culture, and opens the possibility that quantitative trait expression in natural environments can be analyzed in an unmanipulative way.},

   Pages = {227-239},
   Abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was formulated 12 years ago in an attempt to offer a proximate mechanism by which female choice of males could be explained by endocrine control of honest signalling. The hypothesis suggested that testosterone has a dual effect in males of controlling the development of sexual signals while causing immunosuppression. Our purpose in this review is to examine the empirical evidence to date that has attempted to test the hypothesis, and to conduct a meta-analysis on two of the assumptions of the hypothesis, that testosterone reduces immunocompetence and increases parasitism, to ascertain any statistical trend in the data. There is some evidence to suggest that testosterone is responsible for the magnitude of trait expression or development of sexual traits, but this is by no means conclusive. The results of many studies attempting to find evidence for the supposed immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone are difficult to interpret since they are observational rather than experimental. Of the experimental studies, the data obtained are ambiguous, and this is reflected in the result of the meta-analysis. Overall, the meta-analysis found a significant suppressive effect of testosterone on immunity, in support of the hypothesis, but this effect disappeared when we controlled for multiple studies on the same species. There was no effect of testosterone on direct measures of immunity, but it did increase ectoparasite abundance in several studies, in particular in reptiles. A funnel analysis indicated that the results were robust to a publication bias. Alternative substances that interact with testosterone, such as glucocorticoids, may be important. Ultimately, a greater understanding is required of the complex relationships that exist both within and between the endocrine and immune systems and their consequences for mate choice decision making.

   Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that females of the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus exercise post-copulatory choice over the paternity of their offspring. There is evidence that these choices are made in relation to the genetic compatibility of mates rather than their absolute quality, but the magnitude of heritable differences in males has not been thoroughly examined. Using a half-sib breeding design we measured additive genetic variance and dam effects in a suite of reproductive and non-reproductive traits. Both components explained relatively little of the phenotypic variance across traits. The dam component in our design contains variance caused by both maternal effects and dominance. If maternal effects are negligible as suggested by previous studies, our data suggest that dominance variance is an important source of variation in these traits. The lack of additive genetic variation, but possible existence of large amounts of non-additive genetic variation is consistent with the idea that female mate choice and multiple mating may be driven by differences in genetic compatibility between potential mates rather than by differences in genetic quality.},

This suggestion is examined using a large set of morphological traits in the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. In this case the difference between the two estimates is very small. Further, by simulation it is shown that the phenotypic correlations are as good as, or better than, the estimated genetic correlations as estimates of the true genetic correlations. Examination of other data sets of morphological traits suggests that the phenotypic correlation may, in general, be a suitable substitute for the estimated genetic correlation. However, because the number of such examinations is still small, a protocol is suggested in which two sets of genetic analyses are undertaken to confirm the assumption in a large comparative analysis.},

   Abstract = {The genetic correlation is a central parameter of quantitative genetics, providing a measure of the rate at which traits respond to indirect selection (i.e., selection that does not act upon the traits under study, but some other trait with which they have genes in common). In this paper, I review the pattern of variation among four combinations of traits: life history x life history (L x L), morphological x morphological (M x M), life history x morphological (L x M), and behavioral x behavioral (B x B). A few other combinations were investigated, but insufficient data were obtained for separate analysis. A total of 1798 correlations, distributed over 51 different animal and plant species, were analyzed. The analysis was conducted at two levels: first by dividing the data set solely by trait combination, and second by blocking the data by trait combination and species. Because selection will tend to fix alleles that show positive correlations with fitness traits faster than those that are negative and because the latter are expected to arise more frequently by mutation, correlations between life-history traits are predicted to be more often negative than those between morphological traits. This prediction was supported, with the ranking in decreasing proportion of negative correlations being: L x L > L x M > B x B > M x M. The mean magnitude of the genetic correlation shows little variation among morphological and life-history combinations, and the distribution of values is remarkably flat. However, the estimated standard errors and the coefficient of variation (SE/r(G)) are large, making it difficult to separate biological factors influencing the pattern of dispersion from experimental error. Analysis of the phenotypic and genetic correlations suggest that for the combinations M x M and L x M, but not L x L or B x B, the phenotypic correlation is an adequate estimate of the genetic correlation.},

This equation can be used to predict changes in trait values or to retrospectively estimate the selection gradient and is thus a central equation of evolutionary quantitative genetics. Genetic variances and covariances will be reduced by stabilizing selection, directional selection and drift, and increased by mutation. Changes in trait values resulting from directional selection that are comparable with differences observed among species are readily obtainable in short geological time spans (< 5000 generations) with selection intensities so small that they would have an insignificant effect on the G matrix (of course it is possible that such changes came about by strong selection over a few generations, followed by long periods of stasis; there is insufficient evidence to presently distinguish these two possibilities). On the other hand, observed effective population sizes are sufficiently small that considerable changes in G can be expected from drift alone. The action of drift can be distinguished from selection because the former produces a proportional change in G whereas the latter, in general, will not. A survey of studies examining variation in G suggests that the null hypothesis that most of the variation can be attributed to drift rather than selection cannot be rejected. However, more research on the predicted statistical distribution of G as a result of selection and/or drift is required and further development of statistical tests to distinguish these two forces needs to be made.},

   Abstract = {There is considerable interest in comparing genetic variance- covariances matrices (G matrix). However, present methods are difficult to implement and cannot readily be extended to incorporate effects of other variables such as habitat, sex, or location. In this paper I present a method based oil MANOVA that can be done using only standard statistical packages (coding for the method using SPLUS is available from the author). The crux of file approach is to use the jackknife method to estimate the pseudovalues Of the estimates: these estimates can then be used as datapoints in a MANOVA. I illustrate the method using two published datasets: (I) variation in G matrices resulting from differences in rearing condition. species, and sex in the crickets Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus: and (2) variation in G matrices associated with habitat and history ill the amphipod Gammarus minus.},

   Abstract = {In this paper, we present an analysis of genetic variation in three wild populations of the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica. We estimated the P, E, and G matrices for six linear morphological measurements and tested for variation among populations using the Flury hierarchical method and the jackknife followed by MANOVA method. Because of nonpositive-definite matrices, we had to employ 'bending' to analyse the G and E matrices with the Flury method. Both statistical methods agree in finding that the P and G matrices are significantly different but comparison between the analysis of the P matrices and pairwise analyses of the P, E, and G matrices suggests caution in interpreting the Flury results concerning differences in matrix structure. The significant variation among the populations in the G matrices appears to be due in large measure to the most geographically distant population.},

   Pages = {1017-1032},
   Abstract = {Quantitative genetics is at or is fast approaching its centennial. In this perspective I consider five current issues pertinent to the application of quantitative genetics to evolutionary theory. First, I discuss the utility of a quantitative genetic perspective in describing genetic variation at two very different levels of resolution, (1) in natural, free-ranging populations and (2) to describe variation at the level of DNA transcription. Whereas quantitative genetics can serve as a very useful descriptor of genetic variation, its greater usefulness is in predicting evolutionary change, particularly when used in the first instance (wild populations). Second, I review the contributions of Quantitative trait loci (QLT) analysis in determining the number of loci and distribution of their genetic effects, the possible importance of identifying specific genes, and the ability of the multivariate breeder's equation to predict the results of bivariate selection experiments. QLT analyses appear to indicate that genetic effects are skewed, that at least 20 loci are generally involved, with an unknown number of alleles, and that a few loci have major effects. However, epistatic effects are common, which means that such loci might not have population-wide major effects: this question waits upon (QTL) analyses conducted on more than a few inbred lines. Third, I examine the importance of research into the action of specific genes on traits. Although great progress has been made in identifying specific genes contributing to trait variation, the high level of gene interactions underlying quantitative traits makes it unlikely that in the near future we will have mechanistic models for such traits, or that these would have greater predictive power than quantitative genetic models. In the fourth section I present evidence that the results of bivariate selection experiments when selection is antagonistic to the genetic covariance are frequently not well predicted by the multivariate breeder's equation. Bivariate experiments that combine both selection and functional analyses are urgently needed. Finally, I discuss the importance of gaining more insight, both theoretical and empirical, on the evolution of the G and P matrices.},

   Abstract = {This study is concerned with statistical methods used for the analysis of comparative data (in which observations are not expected to be independent because they are sampled across phylogenetic ally related species). The phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS), and phylogenetic autocorrelation (PA) methods are compared. Although the independent contrasts are not orthogonal, they are independent if the data conform to the Brownian motion model of evolution on which they are based. It is shown that uncentered correlations and regressions through the origin using the PIC method are identical to those obtained using PGLS with an intercept included in the model. The PIC method is a special case of PGLS. Corrected standard errors are given for estimates of the ancestral states based on the PGLS approach. The treatment of trees with hard polytomies is discussed and is shown to be an algorithmic rather than a statistical problem. Some of the relationships among the methods are shown graphically using the multivariate space in which variables are represented as vectors with respect to OTUs used as coordinate axes. The maximum-likelihood estimate of the autoregressive parameter, rho, has not been computed correctly in previous studies (an appendix with MATLAB code provides a corrected algorithm). The importance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connection matrix, W, for the distribution of rho is discussed. The PA method is shown to have several problems that limit its usefulness in comparative studies. Although the PA method is a generalized least-squares procedure, it cannot be made equivalent to the PGLS method using a phylogenetic model.},

Here we present data from damselflies reared from egg to adult under day lengths mimicking the start or end ( time constrained) of the season at high and low food level. These data show that an important component of immunity is suppressed under time-constrained development as well as under low food conditions and that fat storage is affected only by food availability. Intriguingly, the physiological responses are partly decoupled from age and size at maturity, which indicates that the predictive value of traits such as age and size at maturity might well be restricted.},

   Abstract = {Breed additive, dominance, and epistatic loss effects are of concern in the genetic evaluation of a multibreed population. Multiple regression equations used for fitting these effects may show a high degree of multicollinearity among predictor variables. Typically, when strong linear relationships exist, the regression coefficients have large SE and are sensitive to changes in the data file and to the addition or deletion of variables in the model. Generalized ridge regression methods were applied to obtain stable estimates of direct and maternal breed additive, dominance, and epistatic loss effects in the presence of multicollinearity among predictor variables. Preweaning weight gains of beef calves in Ontario, Canada, from 1986 to 1999 were analyzed. The genetic model included fixed direct and maternal breed additive, dominance, and epistatic loss effects, fixed environmental effects of age of the calf, contemporary group, and age of the dam x sex of the calf, random additive direct and maternal genetic effects, and random maternal permanent environment effect. The degree and the nature of the multicollinearity were identified and ridge regression methods were used as an alternative to ordinary least squares (LS). Ridge parameters were obtained using two different objective methods: 1) generalized ridge estimator of Hoerl and Kennard (R1); and 2) bootstrap in combination with cross-validation (R2). Both ridge regression methods outperformed the LS estimator with respect to mean squared error of predictions (MSEP) and variance inflation factors (VIF) computed over 100 bootstrap samples. The MSEP of RI and R2 were similar, and they were 3% less than the MSEP of LS. The average VIF of LS, R1, and R2 were equal to 26.81, 6.10, and 4.18, respectively. Ridge regression methods were particularly effective in decreasing the multicollinearity involving predictor variables of breed additive effects. Because of a high degree of confounding between estimates of maternal dominance and direct epistatic loss effects, it was not possible to compare the relative importance of these effects with a high level of confidence. The inclusion of epistatic loss effects in the additive-dominance model did not cause noticeable reranking of sires, dams, and calves based on across-breed EBV. More precise estimates of breed effects as a result of this study may result in more stable across-breed estimated breeding values over the years.},

   Abstract = {Inherited environmental effects are those components of the phenotype that are derived from either parent, apart from nuclear genes. Inherited environmental effects arise as the product of parental genes and the parental environment, or their interation, and can include contributions that reflect the abiotic, nutritional, and other ecological features of a parental environment. Separating the impact of inherited environmental effects from inherited genetic effects on offspring phenotype variation has been and continues to be a challenge. This complexity is represented in the presentation of a qualitative model that distinguishes the possible paths of nongenetic cross-generational transmission. This model serves as the framework for considering the nature, in published works, of what was actually measured. Empirical evidence of inherited environmental effects arising from these pathways is documented for a diversity of plant and animal taxa. From these results one can conclude that the impact of inherited environmental effects on offspring can be positive or negative depending on the nature of the contribution and the ecological context in which the offspring exists. Finally, there is a description of theoretical and experimental efforts to understand the consequences of parental effects relative to their impact on population dynamics, the expression of adaptive phenotype plasticity, and character evolution.},

   Abstract = {Secondary sexual characters are thought to indicate individual quality. Expression of sex-limited traits in an extravagant state may require both the underlying genes and the available nutrient resources. The assessment of the relative contribution of genes, environment, and body condition is relevant for understanding to that extent the extravagant trait may signal genotypic or phenotypic quality of the individual. In birds, usually only the males are ornamented. In the barn owl, Tyto alba, both females and males display sex-limited plumage traits. Males are commonly lighter colored and females spottier. In an experiment with combined cross-fostering and brood size manipulation we determined the relative contribution of genes, environment, and body condition to the variation in plumage coloration and plumage spottiness. The partial cross- fostering experiment tested the relative importance of shared genes and a shared environment for the resemblance of related birds. Siblings raised in different nests converged toward similar trait values, offspring resembled the true but not the foster parents, and plumage traits of unrelated nestlings sharing the same nest were not correlated. Results were not inflated by maternal effects detectable in the mother's phenotype, because middaughter to mother resemblance was not higher than midson to father resemblance. This suggests that plumage coloration and spottiness are largely genetically inherited traits, and that the rearing environment does not have a strong impact on the expression of these traits. To further investigate whether the two sex-limited traits are condition dependent, brood sizes were manipulated. Enlargement or reduction of broods by two nestlings resulted in lower and higher body mass of nestlings, respectively. However, nestlings raised in enlarged or reduced broods did not show either a significantly darker or lighter or a more or less spotted plumage. We did not detect any genotype-by-environment interaction. In conclusion, simultaneous cross-fostering and brood size manipulation demonstrate that additive genetic variance for plumage coloration and spottiness is maintained and that both the rearing environment and body condition do not account for a large proportion of the phenotypic variance in female and male ornamentations.},

   Abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanism underlying the expression of melanin-based sex-traits may help us to understand their signalling function. Potential sources of inter-individual variation are the total amount of melanins produced but also how biochemical precursors are allocated into the eumelanin and phaeomelanin pigments responsible for black and reddish-brown colours, respectively. In the barn owl (Tyto alba), a eumelanin trait (referred to as 'plumage spottiness') signals immunocompetence towards an artificially administrated antigen and parasite resistance in females, whereas a phaeomelanin trait ('plumage coloration') signals investment in reproduction in males. This raises the question whether plumage coloration and spottiness are expressed independent of each other. To investigate this question, we have studied the genetics of these two plumage traits. Crossfostering experiments showed that, for each trait, phenotypic variation has a strong genetic component, whereas no environmental component could be detected. Plumage coloration is autosomally inherited, as suggested by the similar paternal-to-maternal contribution to offspring coloration. In contrast, plumage spottiness may be sex-linked inherited (in birds, females are heterogametic). That proposition arises from the observation that sons resembled their mother more than their father and that daughters resembled only their father. Despite plumage coloration and spottiness signalling different qualities, these two traits are not inherited independent of each other, darker birds being spottier. This suggests that the extent to which coloration and spottiness are expressed depends on the total amount of melanin produced (with more melanin leading to a both darker and spottier plumage) rather than on differential allocation of melanin into plumage coloration. and spottiness (in such a case, darker birds should have been less spotted). A gene controlling the production of melanin pigments may be located on sex-chromosomes, since the phenotypic correlation between coloration and spottiness was stronger in males than in females.},

Although such a variation can be large, little is known about its functional value. Correlative data, however, can help suggest testable hypotheses about potential covariation between reproductive parameters and a colour polymorphism displayed by individuals belonging to a single population. In this context, we studied two Swiss populations of tawny owls Strix aluco, a polymorphic species that varies in coloration from reddish- brown to grey. Observations in the first population showed that although greyer females had shorter tarsi, they produced heavier offspring in two of three years. Pairing with respect to plumage coloration was not significantly disassortative, indicating that these correlations were probably not inflated by plumage coloration of the mate. In the second population, where breeding females had been monitored for 14 years, the proportion of all breeding females that were reddish-brown was greater in years when the breeding density was lower. Capture- recapture analyses show that the latter result is explained by the fact that greyish females bred less often than reddish- brown females, although their survival probability was similar. The number of greyer breeding females was greater when spring/summer temperatures were lower. When combined, the results from the two populations lend support to the hypothesis that grey females do not breed every year, but produce offspring of higher quality. Whatever the mechanism underlying the correlations reported in this study, colour polymorphism in female tawny owls appears to reflect some components of individual quality.},

   Abstract = {The hypothesis that ornaments can honestly signal quality only if their expression is condition-dependent has dominated the study of the evolution and function of colour traits. Much less interest has been devoted to the adaptive function of colour traits for which the expression is not, or is to a low extent, sensitive to body condition and the environment in which individuals live. The aim of the present paper is to review the current theoretical and empirical knowledge of the evolution, maintenance and adaptive function of colour plumage traits for which the expression is mainly under genetic control. The finding that in many bird species the inheritance of colour morphs follows the laws of Mendel indicates that genetic colour polymorphism is frequent. Polymorphism may have evolved or be maintained because each colour morph facilitates the exploitation of alternative ecological niches as suggested by the observation that individuals are not randomly distributed among habitats with respect to coloration. Consistent with the hypothesis that different colour morphs are linked to alternative strategies is the finding that in a majority of species polymorphism is associated with reproductive parameters, and behavioural, life-history and physiological traits. Experimental studies showed that such covariations can have a genetic basis. These observations suggest that colour polymorphism has an adaptive function. Aviary and field experiments demonstrated that colour polymorphism is used as a criterion in mate-choice decisions and dominance interactions confirming the claim that conspecifics assess each other's colour morphs. The factors favouring the evolution and maintenance of genetic variation in coloration are reviewed, but empirical data are virtually lacking to assess their importance. Although current theory predicts that only condition-dependent traits can signal quality, the present review shows that genetically inherited morphs can reveal the same qualities. The study of genetic colour polymorphism will provide important and original insights on the adaptive function of conspicuous traits.},

The former assumption is well supported by empirical evidence. We discuss the evidence for the latter assumption. These two assumptions lead inevitably to the capture of genetic variance into sexually selected traits concomitantly with the evolution of condition dependence. We present a simple genetic model to illustrate this view. We then explore some implications of genic capture for the coevolution of female preference and male traits. Our exposition of this problem incidentally leads to new insights into the similarities between sexually selected traits and life history traits, and therefore into the maintenance of high genetic variance in the latter.

   Abstract = {Many animals produce and respond to signals made up of multiple components; For example, many avian sexual displays are highly extravagant combinations of visual and acoustic elements, and are: described as being 'multicomponent'. One possible reason for the evolution of such complex signals is that they provide more reliable information for receivers. However, receivers also influence signal evolution in another important way, by how they perceive and process signals: signallers will be selected to produce signals that are more easily received. The potential, role of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals has not previously been considered; in this review I present psychological results that support the notion that two components are better received than one alone. Detection can be improved by producing two components together, thus reducing the reaction:time, increasing the probability of detection and lowering the intensity at which detection occurs. Discriminability of multicomponent stimuli is also made easier through better recognition, faster discrimination learning and multidimensional generalization. In addition, multicomponent stimuli also improve associative learning. I show that multicomponency does indeed improve signal reception in receivers, although the benefits of producing components in two sensory modalities (bimodal multicomponent signals) may be larger and more robust than producing them in just one (unimodal multicomponent signals). This highlights the need for consideration of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals, and suggests that where signal components do not appear to be informative, they may instead be performing an important psychological function.

We show that a simple opponent mechanism receiving equally weighted inputs from cones with peak absorptions at 445 nm and 605 nm efficiently encodes variation in male throat colors. An orthogonal opponent mechanism-the difference between outputs of 530-nm cones and mean of outputs of 445- and 605-nm cones-produces a neural signal that could be used for species recognition and would be largely insensitive to variation in male throat color. We also show that threespine stickleback throats/photopigments are optimized for this coding scheme. These and other findings lead to testable hypotheses about the spectral processing mechanisms present in the threespine stickleback visual systems and the evolutionary interactions that have shaped this signal/receiver system.},

   Abstract = {Many organisms display patchiness in their distribution patterns over a wide range of spatial scales. Patchy distribution patterns can be caused by processes such as growth, migration, reproduction, and mortality, which result in neighboring areas being more likely to contain a species than distant areas, a phenomenon known as positive spatial autocorrelation. When species are patchily distributed, the within-species spatial randomness assumptions of the standard statistical tests for detecting species associations are seriously violated. Using these tests under such circumstances can lead to incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis. To address this problem we introduce a new test for detecting species associations-the random patterns test. This test takes into account spatial autocorrelation by including the characteristics of the spatial pattern of each species into the null model. A randomization procedure was used to generate the null distribution of the test statistic. The random patterns test is illustrated with data collected from an herbaceous understory community of a Eucalyptus forest near Canberra, Australia.},

   Abstract = {Traditional statistical techniques for detecting between- species spatial association patterns are invalidated when within-species spatial distributions exhibit patchy, clumped. or other kinds of spatial autocorrelation. To overcome this problem three alternative null models are considered They are the 'patch model', the 'random shifts' model, and the 'random patterns' model. However, none of these three models has been satisfactorily validated, in the sense of confirming that they are able to generate acceptable type I error rates with randomly generated data which is itself spatially autocorrelated. The primary aim of this article is to provide such a validation in the context of a statistical test for pairwise species association. Three different pattern- generating algorithms were used to create 'pseudo-observed' spatially autocorrelated species distribution maps. When applied to these distribution maps, the random patterns null model generated acceptable type I error rates across a wide range of levels of spatial autocorrelation. The random shifts null model was excessively liberal at the highest levels of spatial autocorrelation, and the patch model showed a trend for conservatism. However generalisations could not be made, as there was evidence that the validation results were sensitive to differences in the type of spatial autocorrelation modelled by the three different pattern-generating algorithms. Application of each null model to field data highlighted two general statistical issues. The first is well known, and is the requirement of ensuring that the assumptions underlying the null model are met by the data. Violation of assumptions can lead to shifts in the type I error rate, and hence invalidation of the test. The second is more subtle, and is the question of whether the null model being used is the most appropriate one for investigating the question of interest. This latter issue is illustrated through comparison of the patch model with the other null models, as the patch model is based on different underlying ecological assumptions.},

   Abstract = {Variation among bird species in growth rates is traditionally attributed to differences in energy availability and developmental mode. However, the extent and form of competition among siblings for limited food resources may also be an important determinant. Kin-selection-based models of intrabrood competition suggest that nestling growth rates should be highest in those species in which siblings are likely to be less genetically related to one another (half-sibs rather than full-sibs). We test this novel prediction using the frequency of multiple paternity as an index of average sib relatedness within broods. As predicted, we find a significant positive association between the rate of multiple paternity within broods and nestling growth rates. Furthermore, this holds true when we control for the effects of variation in other factors that may be associated with variation in growth rate, such as body size, brood size, mating system and the form of parental care. We suggest, therefore, that variation in growth rate among bird species is not simply dependent on proximate ecological and developmental factors but is also strongly influenced by interactions, over an evolutionary time-scale, among kin.},

   Abstract = {A review of the literature reveals that, if females prefer traits that deviate from the population mean. they usually prefer traits of greater quantity. In cases in which the sensory bases of these preferences are identified, females prefer traits of greater quantity because these traits elicit greater sensory stimulation. However, two caveats apply. First, the studies surveyed might not represent an unbiased sample of mate choice, because researchers usually study systems characterized by exaggerated traits. Second, a preference for traits of greater quantity does not suggest that preference for average traits is unimportant; it might be more usual than preference for exaggerated traits. Phylogenetic comparisons sometimes allow one to distinguish among competing hypotheses for the evolution of female mating preferences. Two hypotheses, Fisher's theory of "runaway" sexual selection and the "good genes" hypothesis, predict that traits and preferences coevolve, whereas the "sensory exploitation" hypothesis predicts that males evolve traits to exploit preexisting female biases. Some studies of frogs and fish support the sensory exploitation hypothesis. although this does not exclude the role of other factors in establishing the preexisting bias or in the subsequent elaboration of the preference. It is suggested that studies of mate choice will benefit by a more integrative approach, especially one that combines knowledge of sensory mechanisms with appropriate phylogenetic comparisons.},

In species with highly variable populations, annual variation in recruitment was positively related to the return rate of adults between successive breeding seasons. In stable populations, more recruits were found in years with low return rates of breeding adults. This identifies a gradient, associated with the position of the species along a "slow-fast" continuum of life history variation, from highly variable populations with a recruitment-driven demography to stable, strongly density-regulated populations with a survival-restricted demography. These results suggest that patterns in avian population fluctuations can be predicted from a knowledge of life-history characteristics and/or temporal variation in certain demographic traits.},

However, gene flow across the partial postzygotic barrier (introgression) is almost exclusively restricted to autosomal loci, suggesting strong selection against introgression of sex-linked genes. In addition to this partial postzygotic barrier, character displacement of male plumage characteristics has previously been shown to reinforce prezygotic isolation in these birds. We show that male plumage traits involved in reinforcing prezygotic isolation are sex linked. These results suggest a major role of sex-chromosome evolution in mediating post- and prezygotic barriers to gene flow and point to a causal link in the development of the two forms of reproductive isolation.},

Honest advertisement models of sexual selection propose that male ornaments, including coloration, are reliable indicators of male quality. Because of their simultaneous effects on male coloration and immunity, carotenoids might mediate the hypothesized relationship between the expression of epigamic coloration and parasitism in vertebrates. We analyzed the relationship between immune profile and concentration of lutein, the most abundant carotenoid in the plasma of male barn swallows (Hirundo rustica). Consistent with our predictions, lutein plasma concentration was negatively correlated with gamma-globulin plasma levels and concentration of selected leukocyte types in peripheral blood, suggesting that, to exert immune function, carotenoids are taken up from plasma, thus becoming unavailable for epigamic signaling. The coloration of red feathers of the throat of adult males was positively related to plasma concentration of lutein, but not with immunologic variables, consistent with the idea that more brightly colored males do not pay a larger immunological cost for their cole ration compared with less brightly colored males. Length of male rail ornaments, which is currently under directional sexual selection, was positively correlated with lutein plasma levels. In species where carotenoids limit immune function, demands for pigments for sexual signaling might compete with those for immunity, thus generating a mechanism that enforces honesty on the signal.},

Transmission of carotenoids to the eggs may affect development and maturation of immunity in offspring, but carotenoids may be available to females in limiting amounts. Females may thus transfer carotenoids to the eggs differentially in relation to the reproductive value of the offspring as affected by sexual ornamentation of their father. In this study of maternal allocation of carotenoids to the eggs in the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), females whose immune system had been experimentally challenged with an antigen had smaller lutein concentrations in their eggs than controls. We manipulated the size of a secondary sexual character (tail length) of males, and analysed the effect of manipulation on allocation of lutein to eggs by their vaccinated mates. Contrary to our prediction based on parental allocation theory, mates of tail-shortened males had a larger lutein concentration in their eggs compared with those of control and tail-elongated males. According to previous studies, offspring of short-tailed males have larger exposure and/or susceptibility to parasites. A larger lutein concentration in the eggs of females mated to males with experimentally reduced ornaments may thus reflect adaptive maternal strategies to enhance offspring viability.},

Because carotenoids can be scarce in nature and serve valuable physiological functions, only the highest-quality individuals are thought to acquire or allocate more pigments for use in sexual displays. 2. A critical but rarely tested assumption of carotenoid-based signals is that the colour of pigmented feather patches directly reveals the total amount of carotenoids contained within them. 3. We studied the relationship between carotenoid-based coloration (hue, chroma and brightness) and the pigment content of tail feathers in wild-caught and captive male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris [Linnaeus]). Greenfinches incorporate two main carotenoids - canary xanthophylls A and B - into feathers to develop yellow patches of colour in their tail. 4. Variation in feather carotenoid content explained 32-51% of variation in chroma and hue of the yellow parts of tail feathers, while feather brightness was not significantly related to carotenoid concentration. Hence, chroma and hue appear good candidates to indicate feather carotenoid content. 5. Birds with the most colourful feathers deposited significantly more of both canary xanthophylls into plumage. Thus, there does not appear to be a specific biochemical strategy for becoming colourful in greenfinches; males instead follow the general decision rule to deposit as many xanthophylls as possible into feathers to become yellow.},

The prediction of this hypothesis, namely that individuals with brighter plumage are able to mount stronger immune responses against novel antigens and reveal generally better health state, was tested in captive male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris). Greenfinches with brighter yellow breast feathers showed stronger humoral immune response against novel antigen (SRBC) while no relationship between plumage coloration and an estimate of cell-mediated immune responsiveness (PHA response) was detected. Elaborately ornamented individuals had better general health state as indicated by the negative correlations between plumage brightness and heterophil haemoconcentration.

Two closed herds of different size and two traits, (i) pre-weaning average daily gain and (ii) litter size at birth, were considered. Three levels of additive direct and maternal genetic correlations (r (dm) ) were assumed to each trait. Four mixed models (denoted as GRM1 through GRM4) were used to generate data sets. Model GRM1 included only additive direct genetic effects, GRM2 included only additive direct genetic and common litter effects, GRM3 included only additive direct and maternal genetic effects and GRM4 included all the random effects. Four mixed animal models (defined as EPM1 through EPM4) were defined for estimating genetic parameters similar to GRM. Data from each GRM were fitted with EPM1 through EPM4. The largest biased estimates of additive genetic variance were obtained when EPM1 was fitted to data generated assuming the presence of either additive maternal genetic, common litter effects or a combination thereof. The bias of estimated additive direct genetic variance (VA(d) ) increased and those of recidual variance (VE) decreased with an increase in level of r (dm) when GRM3 was used. EPM1, EPM2 and EPM3 resulted in biased estimation of the direct genetic variances. EPM4 was the most accurate in each GRM. Phenotypic selection substantially increased bias of estimated additive direct genetic effect and its mean square error in trait 1, but decreased those in trait 2 when ignored in the statistical model. For trait 2, estimates under phenotypic selection were more biased than those under random selection. It was concluded that statistical models for estimating variance components should include all random effects considered to avoid bias.},

   Pages = {2156-2167},
   Abstract = {Crucial to understanding the process of natural selection is characterizing phenotypic selection. Measures of phenotypic selection can be biased by environmental variation among individuals that causes a spurious correlation between a trait and fitness. One solution is analyzing genotypic data, rather than phenotypic data. Genotypic data, however, are difficult to gather, can be gathered from few species, and typically have low statistical power. Environmental correlations may act through traits other than through fitness itself. A path analytic framework, which includes measures of such traits, may reduce environmental bias in estimates of selection coefficients. We tested the efficacy of path analysis to reduce bias by re-analyzing three experiments where both phenotypic and genotypic data were available. All three consisted of plant species (Impatiens capensis, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Raphanus sativus) grown in experimental plots or the greenhouse. We found that selection coefficients estimated by path analysis using phenotypic data were highly correlated with those based on genotypic data with little systematic bias in estimating the strength of selection. Although not a panacea, using path analysis can substantially reduce environmental biases in estimates of selection coefficients. Such confidence in phenotypic selection estimates is critical for progress in the study of natural selection.},

Models with and without contemporary groups, random or nonrandom parental selection, two levels of heritability, and none or 15% randomly missing pedigree information were considered. Nonrandom parental selection caused similar effects on estimates of variance components from all three methods. When pedigree information was complete, REML and Bayesian estimation were not biased by nonrandom parental selection for models with or without contemporary groups. Method R estimates, however, were strongly biased by nonrandom parental selection when contemporary groups were in the model. The bias was empirically shown to be a consequence of not: fully accounting for gametic phase disequilibrium in the subsamples. The joint effects of nonrandom parental selection and missing pedigree information caused estimates from all methods to be highly biased. Missing pedigree information did not cause biased estimates in random mating populations. Method R estimates usually had greater mean square errors than did REML and Bayesian estimates.},

In particular, because primates often direct their grooming up the dominance hierarchy, it has been suggested that they may exchange grooming for agonistic support. Empirical tests of this hypothesis have resulted in highly inconsistent findings. I synthesized the published literature on the relation between grooming and agonistic support in primates using modern meta-analytical techniques. A meta-analysis of 36 studies carried out on 14 different species showed that a significant positive relation exists between grooming and agonistic support (weighted average r = 0.154, corrected for publication bias). These findings suggest that grooming and agonistic support may have evolved as part of a system of low-cost reciprocal altruism. They also highlight the potential of meta-analysis in tackling the study of behavioral phenomena characterized by low overall frequency and small effect sizes.},

   Abstract = {The rate of change in a continuous variable, measured serially over time, is often used as an outcome in longitudinal studies or clinical trials. When patients terminate the study before the scheduled end of the study, there is a potential for bias in estimation of rate of change using standard methods which ignore the missing data mechanism. These methods include the use of unweighted generalized estimating equations methods and likelihood-based methods assuming an ignorable missing data mechanism. We present a model for analysis of informatively censored data, based on an extension of the two-stage linear random effects model, where each subject's random intercept and slope are allowed to be associated with an underlying time to event. The joint distribution of the continuous responses and the time-to-event variable are then estimated via maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm, and using the bootstrap to calculate standard errors. We illustrate this methodology and compare it to simpler approaches and usual maximum likelihood using data from a multi-centre study of the effects of diet and blood pressure control on progression of renal disease, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study. Sensitivity analyses and simulations are used to evaluate the performance of this methodology in the context of the MDRD data, under various scenarios where the drop-out mechanism is ignorable as well as non-ignorable.

We assume that the male traits are costly indicators of male condition ('handicaps'), and that females benefit directly from a high-condition mate. We find that optimal female preference for a single male trait equals (benefit of condition) x (detectability of male trait) x (honesty of male trait)/(costliness of preference). With two male traits to choose from, females should prefer the one with greatest honesty x detectability, and ignore the second. These results highlight the role of perception in the evolution of both male ornaments and female preferences, and provide a theoretical illustration of 'sensory drive'. They confirm that a less honest male trait can displace a more honest trait if its detectability is sufficiently high. Environmental differences can drive evolutionary divergence between populations in both the male trait and female preference. Even small differences between habitats in detectability of male traits can trigger dramatic change in the female preference. Finally, populations may drift apart in arbitrary directions if choice of different male traits yields equivalent benefits to females.},

   Abstract = {Maternal effects may strongly influence evolutionary response to natural selection but they have been little studied in the wild. We use a novel combination of experimental and statistical methods to estimate maternal effects on condition and clutch size in the collared flycatcher, where we define ''condition'' to be the nongenetic component of clutch size. We found evidence of two maternal effects. The first (m) was the negative effect of mother's clutch size on daughter's condition, when mother's condition was held constant. The second (M) was the positive effect of mother's condition on daughter's condition, when mother clutch size was held constant. These two effects oppose one another because mothers in good condition also lay many eggs. The maternal effects were large: Experimentally adding an egg to a mother's nest reduced clutch sizes of her daughters by 1/4 egg (i.e., m = -0.25). Measured degree of resemblance between mother and daughter clutch sizes yielded M = 0.43. The results weakly support the presence of heritable genetic variation in clutch size: additive genetic variance/total phenotypic variance = 0.33. This estimate was highly variable probably because, as we show, mother-daughter resemblance may depend hardly at all on the amount of genetic variance when maternal effects are present. Daughter-mother regression (a standard method for estimating heritability) is consequently a poor guide to the amount of genetic variance in clutch size. Our results emphasize the value of combining field experiments with observations for studying inheritance.},

   Abstract = {Are measurements of quantitative genetic variation useful for predicting long-term adaptive evolution? To answer this question, I focus on g(max), the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations. Original data on threespine sticklebacks, together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates, show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of g(max) for at least four million years, despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time. Rate of morphological divergence between species is inversely proportional to theta, the angle between the direction of divergence and the direction of greatest genetic variation. The direction of greatest phenotypic variance is not identical with g(max), but for these data is nearly as successful at predicting the direction of species divergence. I interpret the findings to mean that genetic variances and covariances constrain adaptive change in quantitative traits for reasonably long spans of time. An alternative hypothesis, however, cannot be ruled out: that morphological differentiation is biased in the direction g(max) because divergence and g(max) are both shaped by the same natural selection pressures. Either way, the results reveal that adaptive differentiation occurs principally along ''genetic lines of least resistance.''},

The most straightforward and crucial test of 'good genes' models of female extra-pair mating is the comparison of naturally 'cross- fostered' maternal half-siblings sharing the same rearing environment as any systematic differences in performance between the two categories of offspring phenotype can be attributed to differential paternal genetic contribution. We analysed local recruitment and first-year reproductive performance of maternal half-siblings in the coal tit (Parus ater), a passerine bird with high levels of extra-pair paternity. We provide a highly comprehensive measure of the long-term fitness consequences of female extra-pair matings based on a large sample of 736 within-pair offspring (WPO) and 368 extra-pair offspring (EPO) from 91 first and 55 second broods, from which 132 breeders recruited into the study population. In contrast to predictions derived from 'good genes' models, we found no differences in local recruitment and seven parameters of first-year reproductive performance when comparing WPO and EPO. These results question the universal validity of findings in other bird species supporting 'good genes' models, particularly as they are based on the best approximation to female fitness obtained so far.},

It is shown that the rank of the Hadamard product, (P) over cap.(P) over cap is a crucial factor in the estimation of these correlation matrices. Consequently, our procedure begins with an initial estimate of P which is then used to obtain an estimate (P) over cap such that (P) over cap.(P) over cap has its rank less than or equal to some specified value. Initial estimators of the eigenvalues of Omega(i), the correlation matrix for the ith group, are then used to obtain refined estimators which, when put in the diagonal matrix (D) over cap(i) as its diagonal elements, are such that (P) over cap (D) over cap(i)(P) over cap has correlation-matrix structure.

A total of 16 behaviours and actions with a clear agonistic context were identified. Similarity indices (Jaccard Index) were calculated based on the co-occurrence of behaviours at an instance in time. No behaviours were associated at a high enough level to warrant their consideration solely as compound displays. 4. True attack was rare, unpredictable and effective. Escalated fights occurred in < 1% of interactions, with peck attacks which were not escalated into fighting in a further 2% of interactions. The rarity of true attack makes it more useful to look at the relationship between behaviour and interaction outcome (win/lose), than between behaviour and subsequent actions (attack/stay/escape).},

If carotene-based plumage coloration is related to the good-parent hypothesis, we predict that yellow plumage brightness of tit fathers should be positively correlated to their investment in offspring provisioning. Here, we use cross-fostering experiments in blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to show that chick development (as measured by tarsus length) is related to yellowness of the foster father, but not to that of the genetic parents. Using these data, we were able to measure, for the first time to our knowledge, the separate contribution of genetic and environmental factors (i.e. parental plumage coloration) to chick development, and hence parental investment. Our data, which relate carotenoid coloration to models of good parents, and data from other authors, which relate ultraviolet coloration to good-genes models, stress that different kinds of coloration within an individual may provide different units of information to prospective females.},

Development time significantly lengthened from tropical areas to temperate areas. The additive genetic variance for development time in each population was not associated with latitude but was associated with the population mean development time. Additive genetic variance tended to be larger in populations with more extreme development times and appeared to be consistent with allele frequency change. In contrast, the nonadditive genetic variance was not associated with the population mean but was associated with latitude. Levels of nonadditive genetic variance were greatest in the region of the cline where the gradient in the change in mean was greatest, consistent with Barton's (1999) conjecture that the generation of linkage disequilibrium may become an important component of the genetic variance in systems with a spatially varying optimum.},

Genome-wide linkage mapping shows that pelvic reduction is controlled by one major and four minor chromosome regions. Pitx1 maps to the major chromosome region controlling most of the variation in pelvic size. Pelvic- reduced fish show the same left-right asymmetry seen in Pitx1 knockout mice, but do not show changes in Pitx1 protein sequence. Instead, pelvic-reduced sticklebacks show site- specific regulatory changes in Pitx1 expression, with reduced or absent expression in pelvic and caudal fin precursors. Regulatory mutations in major developmental control genes may provide a mechanism for generating rapid skeletal changes in natural populations, while preserving the essential roles of these genes in other processes.},

Although there is evidence for kin-biased helping behaviour in several species(1,4,5), the mechanism of kin recognition underlying this behaviour is poorly understood(2). Vocalizations are the most commonly used cues in avian recognition systems(6,7), but the effectiveness of vocal signals as reliable recognition cues must depend on how they are acquired(6-9). However, there have been no experimental studies of the development of vocal recognition cues in cooperative birds; indeed, the ontogeny of all bird vocalizations other than song is poorly known in any species(10-12). Here, we show that cooperatively breeding long- tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) can discriminate between kin and non-kin according to the individual-specific characteristics of contact calls, and show experimentally that individuals learn these calls from provisioning adults during the nestling period. Finally, we show that the pattern of cooperative behaviour in this species is consistent with the use of recognition cues learned through association.},

Natal dispersal patterns are a major determinant of population kin structure and thus may play a key role in social evolution. We studied natal dispersal in the cooperatively breeding long-tailed tit Aegithalos caudatus, a non-territorial species that does not exhibit delayed dispersal. We investigated the factors associated with local recruitment and dispersal distance using 11 years of data, and generated dispersal distance distributions (DDDs) before and after correcting for sampling bias. We also examined how dispersal direction varied between and within nests, using a novel randomisation method to correct for bias. Recruitment was male-biased and increased with nestling weight, and there were significant nest and year effects. Neither sex nor weight had a significant effect on dispersal distance, but distance increased with brood size and there was a significant nest effect. The observed DDD was right-skewed but the corrected DDD was almost symmetrical, and this correction more than doubled estimates of mean dispersal distance and fledgling recruitment rate. There was no tendency across nests for birds to disperse in a particular direction, but siblings dispersed in similar directions. These results provide a detailed description of natal dispersal in long-tailed tits with minimal bias. They also demonstrate the importance of studying the different aspects of dispersal in combination, and show that direction is an important component of dispersal that is usually overlooked. The pattern of natal dispersal is consistent with the nature of helping behaviour in long-tailed tits, and may play an important role in the evolution and maintenance of cooperation despite the absence of delayed dispersal.},

Moreover, when the overall null hypothesis is rejected, the method provides a framework for isolating the particular components that differ significantly between the groups. Simulation studies reveal that discouragingly large experiments are necessary to obtain acceptable power for comparing genetic covariance component matrices. For example, even in cases of a single trait measured on 900 individuals in a nested design of 100 sires and three dams per sire in each population, the power was only about 0.5 when additive genetic variance differed by a factor of 2.5. Nevertheless, this flexible method makes valid comparison of covariance component matrices possible.},

   Abstract = {To determine the potential for adaptation to a local biotic environment, we examined the magnitude and nature of genetic variation in response to neighboring plants within a natural population of the native California annual, Nemophila menziesii. A total of 22 plants from a natural population were crossed in three reciprocal factorials. The progeny were grown in a greenhouse in nine treatments that varied in conspecific and in the density of a naturally co-occurring grass species, Bromus diandrus increasing the density of each species significantly reduced individual survival, fruit number, and dry weight. Among survivors, we found small to moderate heritability of dry weight within treatments. Additive genetic correlations (r(A)) of dry weight between competitive regimes were generally, large and positive. In no case were they significantly different from 1, as expected under the null hypothesis that the relative performance of the genotypes under consideration is the same in all environments. On the basis of these results, we cannot conclude that the structure of genetic covariation within this population would promote genetic differentiation in response to locally varying conditions of density of these two species. Aspects of the experiment that may have compromised our abililty to detect r(A) differing from 1 are discussed.},

Were, wee report an assay of reproductive traits in a random set of 40 lines from generations 8 and 17, grown together at the same time with plants representing generation 0. For three reproductive traits, mean number of seeds per fruit, number of fruits, and dry mass of the infructescence, the means did not differ significantly among generations. Nevertheless, by generation 17, significant divergence among lines was detected for each trait, indicating accumulation of mutations in some lines. Standardized measures of mutational variance accord with those obtained for other organisms. These findings suggest that the distribution of mutational effects for these traits is approximately symmetric, in contrast to the usual assumption that mutations have predominantly negative effects on traits directly related to fitness. Because distinct generations wore grown contemporaneously, each line was represented by three sublines, and seeds were equal in age, these estimates are free of potentially substantial sources of bias. Title finding of an approximately symmetric distribution of mutational effects invalidates the standard approach for inferring properties of spontaneous mutation and necessitates further development of more general approaches that avoid restrictions on the distribution of mutational effects.},

   Abstract = {As the ultimate source of genetic variation, spontaneous mutation is essential to evolutionary change. Theoretical studies over several decades have revealed the dependence of evolutionary consequences of mutation on specific mutational properties, including genomic mutation rates, U, and the effects of newly arising mutations on individual fitness, s. The recent resurgence of empirical effort to infer these properties for diverse organisms has not achieved consensus. Estimates, which have been obtained by methods that assume mutations are unidirectional in their effects on fitness, are imprecise. Both because a general approach must allow for occurrence of fitness-enhancing mutations, even if these are rare, and because recent evidence demands it, we present a new method for inferring mutational parameters. For the distribution of mutational effects, we retain Keightley's assumption of the gamma distribution, to take advantage of the flexibility of its shape. Because the conventional gamma is one sided, restricting it to unidirectional effects, we include an additional parameter, p, as an amount it is displaced from zero. Estimation is accomplished by Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood. Through a limited set of simulations, we verify the accuracy of this approach. We apply it to analyze data on two reproductive fitness components from a 17- generation mutation-accumulation study of a Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana in which 40 lines sampled in three generations were assayed simultaneously. For these traits, U similar or equal to 0.1-0.2, with distributions of mutational effects broadly spanning zero, such that roughly half the mutations reduce reproductive fitness. One evolutionary consequence of these results is lower extinction risks of small populations of A. thaliana than expected from the process of mutational meltdown. A comprehensive view of the evolutionary consequences of mutation will depend on quantitatively accounting for fitness-enhancing, as well as fitness-reducing, mutations.},

Within the spongy layer of feather barbs, the number of circular keratin rods significantly predicted UV violet chroma, whereas the standard error of the diameter of these rods significantly predicted spectral saturation.

Potential reducibility thus has implications for the analysis of the mixed inheritance model, for example, where genetic variation is assumed to be due to one single locus of large effect and many loci each with a small effect. Similarly, reducibility arises in the detection of quantitative trait loci from incomplete discrete marker data. This paper aims to describe the estimation problem in terms of simple discrete genetic models and the single-site Gibbs sampler.

Applications come from areas as diverse as evolution and conservation research, genealogical research in human, plant and animal populations, and forensic problems including paternity cases, identification following disasters, family reunions and immigration issues. We propose assigning a prior probability distribution to the sample space of pedigrees, calculating the likelihood based on DNA data using available software and posterior probabilities using Bayes' Theorem. Our emphasis here is on the modelling of this prior information in a formal and consistent manner. We introduce the distinction between local and global prior information, whereby local information usually applies to particular components of the pedigree and global prior information refers to more general features. When it is difficult to decide on a prior distribution, robustness to various choices should be studied. When suitable prior information is not available, a flat prior can be used which will then correspond to a strict likelihood approach. In practice, prior information is often considered for these problems, but in a generally ad hoc manner. This paper offers a consistent alternative. We emphasise that many practical problems can be addressed using freely available software.},

   Abstract = {In many vertebrates, males are apparently more affected by adverse environmental conditions, particularly during early stages of development, than are females. Three explanations have been proposed for this pattern. First, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) may result in sexes having different nutritional requirements to achieve the same viability, and males are more commonly the larger sex. Second, reduced performance of males could result from possession of an unguarded sex chromosome combined with environmental dependence in expression of deleterious recessives. Third, the observed difference may be a consequence of possession of a male phenotype, for example, due to higher circulating levels of androgens associated with development of male reproductive organs acting antagonistically on other systems. We used experimental manipulations of rearing conditions, coupled with a molecular genetic technique for gender identification, to test these hypotheses in a population of Collared Flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, a migrant, hole-nesting pas serine bird. Nestlings of that species exhibit sexual size monomorphism, and as with other birds, females are heterogametic. As a consequence, the three hypotheses make different predictions about the way in which gender and the environment will interact. Comparisons of brothers and sisters in a split-brood, partial cross-fostering design revealed no evidence of gender X environment interaction on body size, wing length, body mass, or recruitment to the breeding population in this size monomorphic species. Our results therefore support the first hypothesis, namely, that sex differences in performance in sexually dimorphic species are most likely to be caused by different nutritional requirements. Our experiments allow us to investigate the existence of sex-specific fitness differences across an environmental gradient; such data are important for generating and testing hypotheses relating to adaptive sex allocation. The absence of gender X environment interactions demonstrated here supports recent studies of this species indicating a lack of sex ratio adjustment in response to a related, natural, environmental gradient. The possibility of gender X environment interactions along environmental gradients other than those investigated here should be addressed experimentally.},

From a wild population of blue tits-Parus caeruleus, sexually dimorphic primarily in the ultraviolet(7,8)-we report experimental evidence that females skew the sex ratio of their offspring in response to the ultraviolet plumage ornamentation of their mates. Masking male ultraviolet reflectance reversed a positive correlation between reflectance and brood sex ratio observed in control pairs, demonstrating a causal effect of male ultraviolet ornamentation on offspring sex ratio. Ultraviolet reflectance also predicted male survival to the following breeding season, suggesting that it serves as a viability indicator. When taken together with ecological effects (laying date, nesting area), our experiments reveal that an unexpected amount of control exists over the primary sex ratio in birds, suggesting that chromosomal sex determination may not constrain the sex ratios of multiparous vertebrates.},

However, relatively few studies have demonstrated sexual selection within single species by this mechanism, and there have been few attempts to assess the importance of extrapair paternity in relation to other mechanisms of sexual selection. We report estimates of sexual selection gradients on male secondary sexual plumage characters resulting from extrapair paternity in the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, and compare the importance of this form of sexual selection with that resulting from variation in mate fecundity. Microsatellite genotyping revealed that 15% of nestlings, distributed nonrandomly among 33% of broods (N = 79), were the result of extrapair copulations. Multivariate selection analyses revealed significant positive directional sexual selection on two uncorrelated secondary sexual characters in males (forehead and wing patch size) when fledgling number was used as the measure of fitness. When number of offspring recruiting to the breeding population was used as the measure of male fitness, selection on these traits appeared to be directional and stabilizing, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of cuckolded and cuckolding males revealed that males that sired young through extrapair copulations had wider forehead patches, and were paired to females that bred earlier, than the males that they cuckolded. Path analysis was used to partition selection on these traits into pathways via mate fecundity and sperm competition, and suggested that the sperm competition pathway accounted for between 64 and 90% of the total sexual selection via the two paths. The selection revealed in these analyses is relatively weak in comparison with many other measures of selection in natural populations.

   Abstract = {Many characteristics of organisms in free-living populations appear to be under directional selection, possess additive genetic variance, and yet show no evolutionary response to selection. Avian breeding time and clutch size are often-cited examples of such characters. We report analyses of inheritance of, and selection on, these traits in a long-term study of a wild population of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. We used mixed model analysis with REML estimation ("animal models") to make full use of the information in complex multigenerational pedigrees. Heritability of laying date, but not clutch size, was lower than that estimated previously using parent-offspring regressions, although for both traits there was evidence of substantial additive genetic variance (h(2) = 0.19 and 0.29, respectively). Laying date and clutch size were negatively genetically correlated (r(A) = -0.41 +/- 0.09), implying that selection on one of the traits would cause a correlated response in the other, but there was little evidence to suggest that evolution of either trait would be constrained by correlations with other phenotypic characters. Analysis of selection on these traits in females revealed consistent strong directional fecundity selection for earlier breeding at the level of the phenotype (beta = -0.28 +/- 0.03), but little evidence for stabilising selection on breeding time. We found no evidence that clutch size was independently under selection. Analysis of fecundity selection on breeding values for laying date, estimated from an animal model, indicated that selection acts directly on additive genetic variance underlying breeding time (beta = -0.20 +/- 0.04), but not on clutch size (beta = 0.03 +/- 0.05). In contrast, selection on laying date via adult female survival fluctuated in sign between years, and was opposite in sign for selection on phenotypes (negative) and breeding values (positive). Our data thus suggest that any evolutionary response to selection on laying date is partially constrained by underlying life-history trade-offs, and illustrate the difficulties in using purely phenotypic measures and incomplete fitness estimates to assess evolution of life- history trade-offs. We discuss some of the difficulties associated with understanding the evolution of laying date and clutch size in natural populations.},

The theoretical plausibility of the idea, under some conditions, is firmly established, and there is strong empirical support for conditional sex allocation in some taxa. However, the extent to which this hypothesis can be applied to mammals, particularly ungulates, has been more controversial. We used meta-analysis to review published studies of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis within ungulates and to assess the overall level of empirical support for the hypothesis. Overall, data from 37 studies of 18 species suggested a weak but significant positive correlation between maternal condition and sex ratio (r = +0.09). However, average effect size differed markedly between different categories of studies. Studies using measures of maternal condition that were taken preconception and on the basis of behavioral dominance provided strong evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and the sex ratio (r = +0.17-0.25). In contrast, studies that used morphological or physiological measures of condition that were measured postconception provided little or no evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and sex ratio (r = +0.05-0.06). There are several reasons to suggest that data collected postconception and relying on morphological measures of condition are less likely to capture variables that cause selection for biased sex allocation. In addition, we found that the relationship between sex ratio and maternal condition depended on life-history characteristics; relationships were stronger when sexual size dimorphism was more male biased and when gestation periods were longer. Overall, our analyses suggest that data from ungulates are consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis but only when appropriate measures are used.},

Reconstructed SWS1 pigments of most vertebrate ancestors have lambda(max) values of -360 nm, whereas the ancestral avian pigment has a lambda(max) value of 393 nm. In the nonavian lineage, UV vision in many modern species is inherited directly from the vertebrate ancestor, whereas violet vision in others has evolved by different amino acid replacements at approximate to10 specific sites. In the avian lineage, the origin of the violet pigment and the subsequent restoration of UV pigments in some species are caused by amino acid replacements F49V/F86S/L116V/S118A and S90C, respectively. The use of UV vision is associated strongly with UV-dependent behaviors of organisms.

We investigated whether male ornamentation correlates with mate quality and parental effort. We quantified three aspects of male ornament coloration: (1) size of the patch of chestnut breast feathers, (2) reflectance properties of the chestnut plumage coloration, and (3) reflectance properties of the blue-ultraviolet plumage coloration. We found that males with larger breast patches and brighter plumage provisioned nestlings more often, fledged heavier offspring, and paired with females that nested earlier. Males with plumage coloration that exhibit more ultraviolet hues fledged more offspring. These results suggest that plumage coloration is a reliable indicator of male mate quality and reproductive success. Both melanin-based and structural-based plumages appear to be honest signals of male quality and parental care that can be assessed by competitors or by potential mates.},

Here, a continuous game theory model, a quantitative genetics model, and a three locus major gene model are presented which show that the epistatic handicap mechanism can function, independent of the Fisher process, under reasonable assumptions. Moreover, the game theory model illuminates the connection between the strategic and epistatic handicap mechanisms, and illustrates how sexual selection can cause traits to be canalised. The quantitative genetics and major gene models, together with a fourth model, are used to show that a general argument concerning indirect genetic correlations, which has appeared in a number of papers on sexual selection, is specious. The major gene model also illuminates an important distinction between two definitions of mutation bias. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.},

   Abstract = {The presence of heritable variation in traits is a prerequisite for evolution. The great majority of heritability (h(2)) estimates are performed under laboratory conditions that are characterized by low levels of environmental variability. Very little is known about the effect of environmental variability on the estimation of components of quantitative variation, although theoretical extrapolations from lab studies have been attempted. Here we investigate the effects of environmental heterogeneity on variance component estimation using full-sib families of Gryllus pennsylvanicus split between a homogeneous laboratory environment and a more variable held environment. Although large standard errors prevent demonstration of statistically significant differences among h(2) of traits measured in the two environments for all but one trait, the values of h(2) are, on average, lower in the variable field environment, with a mean reduction of 19%. Developmental time is an exception, exhibiting high levels of additive variance in the field, leading to a higher value of h(2) in the variable environment. Underlying the lower held h(2) estimates are greater components of environmental variance as expected, as well as lower components of genetic variance. In this study, there is no evidence that the increase in the environmental component of variance in the held is any more important in the reduction of h(2) than is the decrease in the additive genetic component. The implications of the relative changes in the two components of variance are discussed.},

   Abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a trait depends not only on the presence of genetic variation, but also on the pattern of genetic correlations (r(g)) among traits. Genetic correlations are most easily measured under homogeneous, controlled laboratory conditions, whereas natural populations typically experience a higher degree of environmental variability. The effect of environmental variability on genetic correlations in the cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, was studied by measuring genetic correlations within and between two environments differing in levels of environmental heterogeneity. Within- environment r(g) among morphological traits measured in the homogeneous laboratory environment were found to be reliable predictors of r(g) measured in the experimental field environment. Laboratory measures of r(g) involving life-history traits, though, were not found to reflect the same correlations measured in the heterogeneous environment. A significant negative genetic correlation between fecundity and developmental time was found in the field environment, yet was not detectable when measured in the laboratory. Phenotypic correlations may be obtained much more easily than genetic correlations, but their usefulness in evolutionary inference depends on the pattern of similarity between the two correlations. A comparison of genetic and phenotypic correlations revealed a close match between the two measures for morphological traits, but revealed only broad similarities when considering life-history traits. Male-female genetic correlations between morphological traits were high (all r(g) > 0.73) and were consistently higher in the field environment than in the laboratory. The genetic correlations between the sexes in developmental time followed the same trend, but the male-female genetic correlation of gonad weights was low in both environments. Across-environment correlations were found to be strong for morphological traits and for gonad weight, whereas the genetic expression of developmental time was found to be dependent on the environment in which the crickets were raised.},

   Abstract = {We demonstrate that egg size in side-blotched lizards is heritable (parent-offspring regressions) and thus will respond to natural selection. Because our estimate of heritability is derived from free-ranging lizards, it is useful for predicting evolutionary response to selection in wild populations. Moreover, our estimate for the heritability of egg size is not likely to be confounded by nongenetic maternal effects that might arise from egg size per se because we estimate a significant parent-offspring correlation for egg size in the face of dramatic experimental manipulation of yolk volume of the egg. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a significant correlation between egg size of the female parent and clutch size of her offspring. Because this correlation is not related to experimentally induce maternal effects, we suggest that it is indicative of a genetic correlation between egg size and clutch size. We synthesize our results from genetic analyses of the trade-off between egg size and clutch size with previously published experiments that document the mechanistic basis of this trade-off. Experimental manipulation of yolk volume has no effect on offspring reproductive traits such as egg size, clutch size, size at maturity, or oviposition date. However, egg size was related to offspring survival during adult phases of the life history. we partitioned survival of offspring during the adult phase of the life history into (1) survival of offspring from winter emergence to the production of the first clutch (i.e., the vitellogenic phase of the first clutch), and (2) survival of the offspring from the production of the first clutch to the end of the reproductive season. Offspring from the first clutch of the reproductive season in the previous year had higher survival during vitellogenesis of their first clutch if these offspring came from small eggs. We did not observe selection during these prelaying phases of adulthood for offspring from later clutches. However, we did find that later clutch offspring from large eggs had the highest survival over the first season of reproduction. The differences in selection on adult survival arising from maternal effects would reinforce previously documented selection that favors the production of small offspring early in the season and large offspring later in the season-a seasonal shift in maternal provisioning. We also report on a significant parent-offspring correlation in lay date and thus significant heritable variation in lay date. We can rule out the possibility of yolk volume as a confounding maternal effect-between genetic effects (i.e., heritable) and nongenetic maternal effects acting on lay date that arise from the maternal trait lay date per se (or other unidentified maternal traits). Nevertheless, we demonstrate how the timing of female reproduction (e.g., date of oviposition and date of hatching) affect reproductive attributes of offspring. Notably, we find that date of hatching has effects on body size at maturity and fecundity of offspring from later clutches. We did not detect comparable effects of lay date on offspring from the first clutch.},

   Abstract = {During 1991 through 1994, natural selection on reproductive effort in side-blotched lizards was indexed by measuring total clutch mass produced on the first clutch of the reproductive season and assessing how such effort in current reproduction affects subsequent survival and clutch production. In addition, selection was also experimentally assessed in free-ranging female side-blotched lizards by (1) surgically decreasing total clutch mass (direct ovarian manipulation) and enhancing clutch mass using (2) exogenous gonadotropin, and (3) exogenous corticosterone. Surgical reduction of clutch mass uniformly enhanced survival. However, increasing clutch mass had more complex effects depending on year. Experimentally enhanced clutch mass enhanced survival in 1991, had no effect on survival in 1992, and decreased survival in 1993. Despite the complexity of these experimental results, they are corroborated by our comparative data. It is important to note that local environmental effects can obscure detection of costs arising from natural variation in reproductive effort, and we removed such effects using path analysis. The striking shift in natural selection favoring females laying a large clutch mass (1991) to selection against females laying a large clutch mass (1993) is associated with an end of a severe multiyear drought. Our natural-history observations suggest that the correlated increase in predatory snake activity on our study site, coincident with the end of the drought, is the agent of natural selection. Although the actual agents of selection (e.g., snake predation versus drought-related effects) are not resolved, the patterns of natural selection measured in our comparative and experimental data are also consistent with year-to-year changes in clutch mass and egg size that would be indicative of rapid short-term evolution in these traits.},

Lifetime reproductive success of experimentally size-altered progeny was studied to address the offspring number and offspring quality trade-off Causes of natural selection on adult reproductive costs were assessed with three complementary manipulations of clutch size, egg size, and total clutch mass. Selective trade- offs between offspring size and number arose from two opposing episodes of directional selection. Fecundity selection favored female parents that laid large clutches of small offspring, but fecundity selection was balanced by survival selection that favored large offspring. Thus, the offspring number and quality tradeoff had a strong stabilizing effect on mean egg size across generations. However, strength and direction of selection arising from adult reproductive costs varied among years. Because reproductive traits were heritable (h(2) = 0.61), selection on adult reproduction led to a large evolutionary response to natural selection. Patterns of selection detected in natural phenotypic variation were largely corroborated by phenotypic manipulations. However, maturational costs of reproduction that were detected with phenotypic manipulations were missed by traditional selection analysis of natural phenotypic variation.},

   Abstract = {We review and discuss the importance of correlational selection (selection for optimal character combinations) in natural Populations. If two or more traits subject to multivariate selection are heritable, correlational selection builds favourable genetic correlations through the formation of linkage disequilibrium at underlying loci governing the traits. However, linkage disequilibria built up by correlational selection are expected to decay rapidly (ie, within a few generations), unless correlational selection is strong and chronic. We argue that frequency-dependent biotic interactions that have 'Red Queen dynamics' (eg, host-parasite interactions, predator-prey relationships or intraspecific arms races) often fuel chronic correlational selection, which is strong enough to maintain adaptive genetic correlations of the kind we describe. We illustrate these processes and phenomena using empirical examples from various plant and animal systems, including our own recent work on the evolutionary dynamics of a heritable throat colour polymorphism in the side-blotched lizard Uta stansburiana. In particular, male and female colour morphs of side-blotched lizards cycle on five- and two-generation (year) timescales under the force of strong frequency-dependent selection. Each morph refines the other morph in a Red Queen dynamic. Strong correlational selection gradients among life history, immunological and morphological traits shape the genetic correlations of the side-blotched lizard polymorphism. We discuss the broader evolutionary consequences of the buildup of co-adapted trait complexes within species, such as the implications for speciation processes.},

Regulation of PO during experimental immune challenge showed that males with dark, homogenous melanin distribution in their wings showed no change in PO levels 24 h after challenge. By contrast males with lighter and/or more heterogenous melanin distribution in their wings tended to show higher PO levels 24 h after immune challenge. The changes in PO levels occur despite the lack of a relationship between wing-pigment distribution and the cellular encapsulation response.

A causal mechanism for this relationship could be reduced availability of carotenoids for immunological application created by increased carotenoid requirements for ornamental development. Alternatively, if more ornamented individuals also have lower intensities of infection, the observed relationship might be explained by healthy individuals being both bright and having low antigen stimulation of lymphocyte transformation and proliferation. Parasite intensities also show relationships with intensity of coloration, and this is used to evaluate the latter explanation.},

A remarkable variation thus seems to exist, even between species that are congeneric and have similar breeding ecologies.

We tested these hypotheses on the bluethroat (Luscinia s. suecica), a socially monogamous, sexually dichromatic bird, in which males have a colorful throat patch consisting of a structurally derived blue area surrounding a melanin-based chestnut spot. Male plumage coloration was objectively quantified by use of reflectance spectrometry.

For natural selection to produce evolutionary change in these variables, there must exist heritable variation. Since nestling traits are not any longer present in parents, traditional offspring-parent regressions cannot estimate heritabilities of these. In this study, a partial cross-fostering experiment was performed, where nestlings of the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) were reciprocally exchanged between nests. The experiment demonstrated a significant heritability of nestling tarsus length and body mass, but not of the growth trajectories followed by individual nestlings. The heritability estimate for tarsus length obtained in the cross-fostering experiment using full-sib analysis was lower than those obtained by offspring-parent regressions. This is likely due to a genotype-by-environment effect on tarsus length, with nestlings destined to become large but in poor condition having a low probability of appearing as parents. The main reason for the low heritability of growth was probably the large within-brood variation in growth pattern due to the initial size hierarchy of nestlings. Nestlings demonstrated targeted growth, where small-sized nestlings that initially grew slower than their siblings, managed to catch up.},

   Abstract = {Genealogical analysis is a powerful tool for analysis of reproductive performance in both natural and captive populations, but assignment of paternity has always been a stumbling block for this sort of work. Statistical methods for determining paternity have undergone several phases of development, ranging from straightforward genetic exclusion to assignment of paternity based on genetic likelihood criteria. In the present study, we present a genetic likelihood-based iterative procedure for fractional allocation of paternity within a progeny pool and apply this method to a population of Chamaelirium luteum, a dioecious member of the Liliaceae. Results from this analysis clearly demonstrate that different males make unequal contributions to the overall progeny pool, with many males contributing essentially nothing to the next generation. Furthermore, the distribution of paternal success among males shows a highly significant departure from (Poisson) randomness. The results from the present analysis were compared with earlier results obtained from the same data set, using likelihood-based categorical paternity assignments. The general biological pattern revealed by the two analyses is the same, but the estimates of reproductive success are only modestly (though significantly) correlated. The iterative procedure makes more complete use of the data and generates a more sharply resolved distribution of male reproductive success.},

   Abstract = {Much of the contemporary study of adaptation in natural populations involves the regression of some component of fitness, usually survivorship or viability, on one or more characters of interest. It is difficult. to apply this approach to measures of paternal reproduction, however, because paternity is typically estimated indirectly from genetic markers, rather than being measured directly from progeny counts. Here, we present maximum Likelihood methods for modelling relative male reproductive success as a log-linear function of one or more potentially predictive features, as well as providing a framework for the assessment of pairwise (male:female) effects, as they affect male reproductive performance. We also provide nonparametric statistical tests for alternative models. Using this formulation, we examine the impact of inflorescence morphology on male reproductive success in Chamaelirium luteum L., and we also assess the importance of intermate distances between males and particular females. While male reproductive success and male inflorescence morphology are both quite variable, reproductive morphology does not appear to predict male reproductive success in this study. Intermate distance is an extremely effective predictor of pairwise success, however; but averaged over females, there is almost no net effect for different males.},

However, as resource allocation to different activities (or organs) during growth is difficult to manipulate, this trade-off has only been experimentally tested by studying the effects of non-pathogenic antigens. By providing some nestling magpies (Pica pica) with methionine, a sulphur amino acid that specifically enhances T- cell immune response in chickens, we investigated this trade- off by directly affecting allocation of limited resources during growth. Results were in accordance with the hypothetical trade-off because nestlings fed with methionine showed a lower growth rate during the four days of methionine administration, but a larger response when fledglings were challenged with phytohaemagglutinin (a measure of the intensity of T- lymphocyte-mediated immune responsiveness) than control nestlings. Surprisingly, we found that control and experimental nestlings fledged with similar body mass, size and condition, but experimental nestlings suffered less from blood parasites (Haemoproteus) and had fewer lymphocytes (a widely used measure of health status) than control nestlings, suggesting a negative effect of blood parasites or other pathogens on nestling growth.},

The following measures of response to selection were analysed: 1) total response in terms of the difference in additive genetic means between last and first generations; 2) the slope (through the origin) of the regression of mean additive genetic value on generation; 3) the linear regression slope of mean additive genetic value on generation. Inferences are based on marginal posterior distributions of the above-defined measures of genetic response, and uncertainties about fixed effects and variance components are taken into account. The marginal posterior distributions were estimated using the Gibbs sampler. Two simulated data sets with heritability levels 0.2 and 0.5 having 5 cycles of selection were used to illustrate the method. Two analyses were carried out for each data set, with partial data (generations 0-2) and with the whole data. The Bayesian analysis differed from a traditional analysis based on best linear unbiased predictors (BLUP) with an animal model, when the amount of information in the data was small. Inferences about selection response were similar with both methods at high heritability values and using all the data for the analysis. The Bayesian approach correctly assessed the degree of uncertainty associated with insufficient information in the data. A Bayesian analysis using 2 different sets of prior distributions for the variance components showed that inferences differed only when the relative amount of information contributed by the data was small.},

It is shown that use of data augmentation leads to conditional posterior distributions which are easy to sample from. The conditional posterior distributions of thresholds and liabilities are independent uniforms and independent truncated normals, respectively. The remaining parameters of the model have conditional posterior distributions which are identical to those in the Gaussian linear model. The methodology is illustrated using a sire model, with an analysis of hip dysplasia in dogs, and the results are compared with those obtained in a previous study, based on approximate maximum likelihood. Two independent Gibbs chains of length 620 000 each were. run, and the Monte-Carlo sampling error of moments of posterior densities were assessed using time series methods. Differences between results obtained from both chains were within the range of the Monte-Carlo sampling error. With the exception of the sire variance and heritability, marginal posterior distributions seemed normal. Hence inferences using the present method were in good agreement with those based on approximate maximum likelihood. Threshold estimates were strongly autocorrelated in the Gibbs sequence, but this can be alleviated using an alternative parameterization.},

   Abstract = {The genetic covariance structure for life-history characters in two populations of cyclically parthenogenetic Daphnia pulex indicates considerable positive correlation among important fitness components, apparently at odds with the expectation if antagonistic pleiotropy is the dominant cause of the maintenance of genetic variation. Although there is no genetic correlation between offspring size and offspring number, present growth and present reproduction are both strongly positively correlated genetically with future reproduction, and early maturity is genetically correlated with larger clutch size. Although the ubiquity of antagonistic pleiotropy has been recently questioned, there are peculiarities of cyclical parthenogenesis that could lead to positive life-history covariance even when negative covariance would be expected in a similar sexual species. These include the influence of nonadditive gene action on evolution in clonally reproducing organisms, and the periodic release of hidden genetic variance within populations of cyclical parthenogens. Examination of matrix similarity, using the bootstrap for distribution-free hypothesis testing, reveals no evidence to suggest that the genetic covariance matrices differ between the populations. However, there is considerable evidence that the phenotypic and environmental covariance matrices differ between populations. These results indicate approximate stability of the genetic covariance matrix within species, an important assumption of many phenotypic evolution models, but should caution against the use of phenotypic in place of genetic covariance matrices.},

Furthermore, this reconstruction can be done in polynomial time. We also provide an example to show that the corresponding reconstruction result does not hold for pedigrees that are not sex-labelled. We then show how any pedigree can also be reconstructed from two functions that just describe certain circuits in the pedigree. Finally, we obtain an enumeration result for pedigrees that is relevant to the question of how many segregating sites are needed to reconstruct pedigrees. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   Abstract = {Applications of quantitative techniques to understanding macroevolutionary patterns typically assume that genetic variances and covariances remain constant. That assumption is tested among 28 populations of the Phyllotis darwini species group (leaf-eared mice). Phenotypic covariances are used as a surrogate for genetic covariances to allow much greater phylogenetic sampling. Two new approaches are applied that extend the comparative method to multivariate data. The efficacy of these techniques are compared, and their sensitivity to sampling error examined. Pairwise matrix correlations of correlation matrices are consistently very high (> 0.90) and show no significant association between matrix similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. Hierarchical decomposition of common principal component (CPC) analyses applied to each clade in the phylogeny rejects the hypothesis that common principal component structure is shared in clades more inclusive than subspecies. Most subspecies also lack a common covariance structure as described by the CPC model. The hypothesis of constant covariances must be rejected, but the magnitudes of divergence in covariance structure appear to be small. Matrix correlations are very sensitive to sampling error, while CPC is not. CPC is a powerful statistical tool that allows detailed testing of underlying patterns of covariation.},

Branch lengths are calculated as the mean disparity in corresponding ancestor- descendent covariances. Branches are longest leading to terminal populations and subspecies, while interspecific branches are relatively short, indicating a general conservation of covariance structure among species despite a high degree of intraspecific variability. Absolute deviations in covariance structure are not correlated with phenotypic divergence. Interpreted in light of other studies, the analyses suggest that deviations in covariance structure are most strongly associated with the formation of diagnosably distinct taxa and stochastic sampling of genotypes at the population level. There is no evidence for restructuring of phenotypic covariance structure in association with reproductive isolation. The results suggest that phenotypic covariances are dynamic over short time scales and do nor support attempts to extrapolate genetic covariance structure to explain or predict macroevolutionary change. This study further demonstrates that branch lengths, which are not usually analyzed in detail, contain valuable evolutionary information complementary to that residing in the branching pattern.},

However, there is very little empirical evidence that these occur. We investigated these trade-offs in caddis flies by experimentally manipulating larval case construction and thereby silk expenditure. Case building diverts protein resources away from larval stores, which are of major importance to adult development in species with little or no adult feeding. We induced fifth-instar Odontocerum albicorne to build new cases and examined the consequences for the morphology of the resulting adults. Rebuilding did not alter larval food consumption or the date of entering pupation, but shortened the duration of the pupal period. Adults that had been induced to expend more silk as larvae had lighter thoraces and smaller wings than the controls, but their abdomens did not differ significantly in mass or nitrogen content. These results suggest a trade-off between larval silk production and the pattern of resource allocation within the adult. The maintenance of the abdomen is likely to preserve reproductive potential, while the reduction in thoracic and wing investment will have negative consequences for flight and associated activities, and possibly for adult longevity.},

   Abstract = {Measuring natural selection has been a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology for more than a century, and techniques developed in the last 20 yr have provided relatively simple means for biologists to do so. Many of these techniques, however, share a common limitation: when applied to phenotypic data, environmentally induced covariances between traits and fitness can lead to biased estimates of selection and misleading predictions about evolutionary change. Utilizing estimates of breeding values instead of phenotypic data with these methods can eliminate environmentally induced bias although this approach is more difficult to implement. Despite this potential limitation to phenotypic methods and the availability of a potential solution, little empirical evidence exists on the extent of environmentally induced bias in phenotypic estimates of selection. In this article, we present a method for detecting bias in phenotypic estimates of selection and demonstrate its use with three independent data sets. Nearly 25% of the phenotypic selection gradients estimated from our data are biased by environmental covariances. We find that bias caused by environmental covariances appears mainly to affect quantitative estimates of the strength of selection based on phenotypic data and that the magnitude of these biases is large. As our estimates of selection are based on data from spatially replicated field experiments, we suggest that our findings on the prevalence of bias caused by environmental covariances are likely to be conservative.},

(Co)Variance components were estimated using a Bayesian threshold animal model via Gibbs sampling. The Gibbs sampler was implemented with both a flat and a proper prior for the genetic covariance matrix. Convergence problems were encountered in > 50% of flat prior analyses, with indications of potential or near posterior impropriety between about round 10 000 and 100 000. Terminations due to non-positive definite genetic covariance matrix occurred in flat prior analyses of the smallest datasets. Use of a proper prior resulted in improved mixing and convergence of the Gibbs chain. In order to avoid (near) impropriety of posteriors and extremely poorly mixing Gibbs chains, a proper prior should be used for the genetic covariance matrix when implementing the Gibbs sampler.},

We ask whether the selective advantage of trichromacy lies in an enhanced ability to find edible leaves or fruit. Further, we ask whether any factor in these two search tasks has constrained the particular set of cone spectral sensitivities observed in all catarrhines, We measured the spectral properties of the natural environments of six primate species in Uganda: Pan troglodytes, Cercopithecus mitis, Cercopithecus ascanius, Lophocebus albigena, Colobus guereza and Colobus badius, We concentrated on the fruit and leaves in their diets and the leaves of the trees that make up the background against which these diet items must be found. We plotted these measured stimuli in colour spaces appropriate for each primate species, and found that both frugivory and folivory are facilitated by the extra dimension of colour vision found in catarrhines but lacking in most other mammals. Furthermore, by treating the task of searching for food as a signal-detection task, we show that, of all possible combinations of cone sensitivities, the spectral positions of the actual primate pigments are optimal for finding fruit or young leaves against the background of mature leaves. This is because the variance of the chromaticities of the mature leaves is minimised in one channel of the primate's colour vision, so allowing anything that is not a mature leaf to stand out.},

Degree of male ornamentation may be used by females as an indicator of paternal effort and thus may be an important factor in mate choice situations. This was tested by observing feeding rates of yellowhammers, a species showing considerable colour variation. Male and female feeding rates were inter-correlated and were both negatively correlated with male coloration. Relative male feeding rate was not correlated with male colour. In spite of a low feeding rate by more highly coloured older males, no effect was found on nestling condition, indicating compensation by high quality food or bigger load per nest visit. Nevertheless, coloration was positively related to the number of fledged young for old males and so may indicate parental quality. These results suggest that older and generally more colourful males may be more experienced and of higher quality and so may be preferred by females.},

For the day-old chicks derived from the high-carotenoid group, the carotenoid levels in the yolk sac membrane, liver; and plasma were approximately 3 times greater than in the control group; however, the other tissues were less responsive. The proportion of lutein (% wt/wt of total carotenoids) was far lower in the liver of the chick than in the yolk. However, in the non-hepatic tissues the proportion of lutein was generally higher than in the yolk. This suggests that discrimination between different carotenoids may occur in the embryo. For the high-carotenoid group, the peroxidative susceptibility of extracts of the yolk, yolk sac membrane, and liver was decreased compared with samples from the control group. Thus, carotenoids may provide antioxidant protection to the tissues. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. 1998.},

   Abstract = {The importance of genetic and environmental variation in condition in shaping evolutionary trade-offs have recently been subject to much theoretical discussion, but is very difficult to investigate empirically in most field-based systems. We present the results from mechanistic experimental manipulations of reproductive investment and condition in two female colour morphs ('orange' and 'yellow') of side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana). We investigated the interactions between throat colour morphs, condition, local social environment and female survival using path-analysis. Using follice-ablation experiments, we show that large clutch size has a negative effect on field survival among yellow females, and that this effect is partly mediated by immunosuppressive effects of large clutches. In orange females these effects were less pronounced, and there was a negative survival effect of strong antibody responses. Hence, we experimentally confirmed our previous findings of correlational selection between female morphotype and immunocompetence, an important condition trait. Manipulation of corticosterone revealed multiple ('pleiotropic') direct and indirect effects of this hormone on both condition and reproductive traits. We argue that interaction effects (e. g. between local environments and genotypes) could explain a substantial fraction of variation in condition and reproduction in natural populations. Increased attention to such interaction effects and their fitness consequences will provide novel insights in field studies of selection and reproductive allocation.},

However, the causes of variation in carotenoid acquisition and physiology among species are poorly known. We measured the concentration of carotenoids in the blood of 80 wild bird species differing in diet, body size and the extent of carotenoid-based traits. Preliminary analyses showed that diet significantly explains interspecific variability in plasma carotenoids. However, dietary influences were apparently overridden by phylogenetic relationships among species, which explained most (65%) of this variability. This phylogenetic effect could be due partly to its covariation with diet, but may also be caused by interspecific differences in carotenoid absorption from food to the blood stream, mediated, for example by endothelial carriers or gut parasites. Carotenoid concentrations also decreased with body size (which may be explained by the allometric relationship between ingestion rate and body mass), and correlated positively with the extent of carotenoid-dependent coloration of plumage and bare parts. Therefore, the acquisition of carotenoids from the diet and their use for both health and display functions seem to be constrained by ecological and physiological aspects linked to the phylogeny and size of the species.},

   Abstract = {Background: Evolution depends on natural selection acting on phenotypic variation, but the genes responsible for phenotypic variation in natural populations of vertebrates are rarely known. The molecular genetic basis for plumage color variation has not been described in any wild bird. Bananaquits (Coereba flaveola) are small passerine birds that occur as two main plumage variants, a widespread yellow morph with dark back and yellow breast and a virtually all black melanic morph. A candidate gene for this color difference is the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a key regulator of melanin synthesis in feather melanocytes. Results: We sequenced the MC1R gene from four Caribbean populations of the bananaquit; two populations of the yellow morph and two populations containing both the yellow morph and the melanic morph. A point mutation resulting in the replacement of glutamate with lysine was present in at least one allele of the MC1R gene in all melanic birds and was absent in all yellow morph birds. This substitution probably causes the color variation, as the same substitution is responsible for melanism in domestic chickens and mice. The evolutionary relationships among the MC IR haplotypes show that the melanic alleles on Grenada and St. Vincent had a single origin. The low prevalence of nonsynonymous substitutions among yellow haplotypes suggests that they have been under stabilizing selection, whereas strong selective constraint on melanic haplotypes is absent. Conclusions: We conclude that a mutation in the MC1R is responsible for the plumage polymorphism in a wild bird population and that the melanic MC1R alleles in Grenada and St. Vincent bananaquit populations have a single evolutionary, origin from a yellow allele.},

The main environmental infleunce on growth was a cohort effect. We also found a substantial heritable component of phenotypic variation for tarsus length (h2 = 0.61), and crossfostering in one year showed no shared environment effect which could account for parent/offspring resemblance. The deteriorating conditions for growth later in the season did not confound our heritability estimates as the time of laying was not correlated to parent size, and no maternal effects operating through egg size were found. We tested for selection during the summer dispersal phase by comparing tarsus length among fullgrown pulli (age 14 days, controlled by repeated measurements of the same individuals later during breeding and the ensuing winter) and the tarsus length of the first year cohort in autumn composed of a mixture of locally born birds remaining within our study area after the dispersal phase and immigrants born outside the study site. Following a season with poor nestling growth, birds with short tarsi were selected against when underweight, suggesting that growth condition is the target of selection. Such selection on those individuals which show the strongest environmental influence on phenotypic variation will reduce the potential for an evolutionary response to selection.},

   Abstract = {A mother can influence a trait in her offspring both by the genes she transmits (Mendelian inheritance) and by maternal attributes that directly affect that trait in her offspring (maternal inheritance). Maternal inheritance can alter the direction, rate, and duration of adaptive evolution from standard Mendelian models and its impact on adaptive evolution is virtually unexplored in natural populations. In a hierarchical quantitative genetic analysis to determine the magnitude and structure of maternal inheritance in the winter annual plant, Collinsia verna, I consider three potential models of inheritance. These range from a standard Mendelian model estimating only direct (i.e., Mendelian) additive and environmental variance components to a maternal inheritance model estimating six additive and environmental variance components: direct additive (sigma(Ao)(2)) and environmental (sigma(Eo)(2)) variances; maternal additive (sigma(Am)(2)) and environmental (sigma(Em)(2)) variances; and the direct-maternal additive (sigma(ApAm)) and environmental (sigma(EoEm)) covariances. The structure of maternal inheritance differs among the 10 traits considered at four stages in the life cycle. Early in the life cycle, seed weight and embryo weight display substantial sigma(Am)(2), a negative sigma(AoAm), and a positive sigma(EoEm) Subsequently, cotyledon diameter displays sigma(Ao)(2) and sigma(Am)(2) of roughly the same magnitude and negative sigma(AoAm). For fall rosettes, leaf number and length are best described by a Mendelian model. In the spring, leaf length displays maternal inheritance with significant sigma(Ao)(2) and sigma(Am)(2) and a negative sigma(AoAm). All maternally inherited traits show significant negative sigma(AoAm). Predicted response to selection under maternal inheritance depends on sigma(Ao)(2) and sigma(Am)(2) as well as sigma(AoAm). Negative sigma(AoAm) results in predicted responses in the opposite direction to selection for seed weight and embryo weight and predicted responses near zero for all subsequent maternally inherited traits. Maternal inheritance persists through the life cycle of this annual plant for a number of size-related traits and will alter the direction and rate of evolutionary response in this population.},

At this level, families are weighted according to the number of pairs within which each family appears, hence by size rather than information content, and information from multiple relationships is lost. Estimates of parameters ale therefore not the most efficient achievable. Here, Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques have been used to partition the population into complete sibships including, if known, prior knowledge of the distribution of family sizes. These pedigrees have then been used with restricted maximum likelihood under an animal model to estimate quantitative genetic parameters. Simulations to compare the properties of parameter estimates with those of existing techniques indicate that the use of sibship reconstruction is superior to earlier methods, having lower mean square errors and showing nonsignificant downward bias. In addition, sibship reconstruction allows the estimation of population allele frequencies that account for the relationships within the sample, so prior knowledge of allele frequencies need not be assumed. Extensions to these techniques allow reconstruction of half sibships when some or all of thr maternal genotypes are known.},

Computer simulation was used to compare the behaviour of these estimators. Bias in estimates of heritability decreased with increasing marker information, decreasing simulated heritability, increasing relatedness and increasing sample size. The techniques displayed reasonable tolerance to the percentage of missing data. The regression-based technique shows least average bias, but largest variance over simulations. Likelihood-based techniques show larger average bias, but smaller variances over estimates. A modified form of the likelihood technique, requiring fewer initial assumptions about population parameters, is presented.

   Abstract = {Independent of age or geographic variation, males of many species of birds exhibit dramatic variation in the expression of elaborate secondary sexual characters. ''Good genes'' models of sexual selection propose that males with relatively low resistance to parasites suffer high parasite loads that inhibit their ability to express these characters fully. In turn, variation in such characters may reliably indicate male quality and may be used by females to choose males. This is the first study to monitor (via mark-recapture) the long-term effects of parasites on color and growth of plumage in individual birds. Specifically, we used house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, a sexually dimorphic species in which females are known to prefer more brightly plumaged males for mating, to test the hypothesis that high parasite load in males is correlated with poor physiological condition and reduced development of male secondary sex characters. Our results clearly demonstrate that both ectoparasitic feather mite (Proctophyllodes sp.) infestations and endoparasitic avian pox viral infections during molt are correlated with poor physiological condition and reduced development of bright male plumage during the same molt period, thus supporting good genes models.},

We compared the sex-specific growth of the last-hatched, competitively disadvantaged chicks with that of synchronously hatched chicks in two successive years. Sons exhibited higher growth rates than daughters in a year with delayed onset of breeding, and this sex-related difference was more pronounced among the asynchronously hatched chicks. Females apparently do not selectively allocate more resources to the last-laid eggs because neonatal body mass and the growth rate of asynchronously hatched chicks did not differ between years, despite the fact that in one of the years, asynchronous chicks hatched from replaced eggs taken randomly from other nests and not from eggs laid last by the incubating female. Among chicks that survived, moderately asynchronous siblings grew at a lower rate than synchronous ones, whereas no difference in mass gain was revealed between synchronous and strongly asynchronous siblings irrespective of their contrasting competitive abilities. We suggest that selection of the fittest asynchronous chicks may improve the overall quality of asynchronous broods, thus favouring the maintenance of asynchronous hatching strategies in variable environments.},

Elongated tails occur sporadically across avian taxa, including cardueline finches (family Fringillidae), suggesting that long tails evolved independently in many lineages. To determine whether a female preference for longer tails predated the evolution of long tails in cardueline finches, we tested female preferences for artificially lengthened tail feathers in male house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus. The house finch is a cardueline finch species with a tail that does not appear to be elongated or sexually selected. In mate choice experiments, females did not demonstrate a preference for lengthened tails over controls.

   Abstract = {Food supply is widely considered to be a major factor in determining life history traits and reproductive performance of birds. However, large spatial and temporal variation in natural available food supply is not always paralleled by proportional changes in energy demand by breeding birds. This necessarily results in variation in the supply-demand ratio and the amount of food available per unit mass of nestling. Because reproductive performance should respond to increases in available supply as a saturation curve, reaching a plateau above A certain threshold of food supply, we predict that variation in supply should change the intensity of selection on reproductive traits. We first tested this prediction using long-term data on nestling growth and survival in Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) breeding over a gradient of habitat richness in Corsica, France. This long-term data analysis evaluates the effect of variation in food supply available to breeding tits using three surrogate variables: interannual variation in peak caterpillar abundance (caterpillar frass fall), offset between breeding date and peak caterpillar abundance, and natural variation in clutch size. We also used an experimental brood size manipulation (+/-3 chicks) to test the effect of varying brood demand on nestling growth. Results of the long-term data analysis show that all three variables affect fledging mass and fledging success in poor habitats, while only fledging mass is affected by variation in offset in rich habitats. Moreover, mean annual fledging success and fledging mass is strongly affected by annual variation in peak caterpillar abundance at low levels' of-abundance, but these effects disappear when food becomes abundant (saturation threshold level of 373 and 560 mg frass.m(-2) .d(-1) for fledging success and fledging mass, respectively). Brood size manipulations confirm these results. In rich habitats, breeding birds can raise three extra chicks without any apparent effects on chick growth, while in poor habitats, chick growth is significantly reduced with brood enlargement. Our study shows that although food limitation can play an important role, it may not always be the primary force shaping life history traits.},

   Abstract = {The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae) is a common ectoparasite in Blue Tit Parus caeruleus nests, whereby adult fleas draw blood from the incubating female host and from the nestlings. Host-parasite interactions are influenced by density-dependent growth of the parasite population, which may result from competitive exploitation or interference between parasite individuals, or from density-dependent host defenses. Understanding density dependence in host-parasite interactions is important for understanding the evolution of parasite virulence and of host defense. Here we investigate density-dependent processes in the dynamics of flea subpopulations. In a first experiment, intended to establish the importance of density dependence in this host-parasite system, the founder density of parasites was manipulated, and reproductive rates of parasites measured. A second experiment was designed to identify the demographic levels at which density dependence arises in the growth of the hen flea population. The experiments show that parasite reproductive rates significantly decrease with increasing founder density. The patterns of egg production, larval production, and adult flea survival suggest that competition between larvae is the main process behind the density-dependent pattern of subpopulation growth. Host mortality, body condition, and blood hematocrit level of the female host and the nestlings were not significantly affected by parasite load, suggesting that adult fleas are not food limited at high densities.},

   Abstract = {Many vertebrates use carotenoid-based signals in social or sexual interactions. Honest signalling via carotenoids implies some limitation of carotenoid-based colour expression among phenotypes in the wild, and at least five limiting proximate mechanisms have been hypothesized. Limitation may arise by carotenoid-availability, genetic constraints, body condition, parasites, or detrimental effects of carotenoids. An understanding of the relative importance of the five mechanisms is relevant in the context of natural and sexual selection acting on signal evolution. In an experimental field study with carotenoid supplementation, simultaneous cross-fostering, manipulation of brood size and ectoparasite load, we investigated the relative importance of these mechanisms for the variation in carotenoid-based coloration of nestling great tits (Parus major). Carotenoid-based plumage coloration was significantly related to genetic origin of nestlings, and was enhanced both in carotenoid-supplemented nestlings, and nestlings raised in reduced broods. We found a tendency for ectoparasite-induced limitation of colour expression and no evidence for detrimental effects of carotenoids on growth pattern, mortality and recruitment of nestlings to the local breeding population. Thus, three of the five proposed mechanisms can generate individual variation in the expression of carotenoid-based plumage coloration in the wild and thus could maintain honesty in a trait potentially used for signalling of individual quality.},

We tested the hypothesis that females exposed to ectoparasites during egg formation will adjust the content of androgens in the yolk. We predicted that when anticipating high levels of parasitism, females deposit (i) less androgens into all eggs of their clutch and (ii) smaller amounts of androgens in eggs late in the laying sequence to facilitate brood reduction. In a field experiment we exposed female great tits (Parus major) to hen fleas (Ceratophyllus gallinae), or kept them free of ectoparasites prior to egg laying. We collected the eggs and measured yolk concentrations of androstenedione (A4), testosterone (T) and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by radioimmunoassay. Among clutches, eggs of ectoparasite-exposed females contained significantly less A4 and tended to contain less T, whereas DHT content was unaffected. Within clutches, content of A4 and T increased significantly with laying order whereas DHT content significantly decreased. These patterns were unaffected by ectoparasites. In summary, our results provide no evidence for hormone-based facilitation of brood reduction under ectoparasite exposure but support the hypothesis that females exposed to ectoparasites reduce levels of T and its precursor A4 in yolk and might thereby reduce the negative effects of parasites on offspring.},

The identification of such a marker may be useful in assessing the efficacy of new therapies in a shorter period. The number of CD4-lymphocyte counts has been proposed as such a potential marker for human immune virus (HIV) trials because of its observed correlation with clinical outcome. But to evaluate the role of CD4 counts as a potential surrogate marker, we must better understand the relationship of clinical outcome to an individual's CD4 count history over time. The Cox proportional hazards regression model is used to study the relationship between CD4 counts as a time-dependent covariate and survival. Because the CD4 counts are measured only periodically and with substantial measurement error and biological variation, standard methods for estimating the parameters in the Cox model by maximizing the partial likelihood are no longer appropriate. Instead, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage the longitudinal CD4 count data are modeled using a repeated measures random components model. In the second stage methods for estimating the parameters in a Cox model when the data are assumed to be of this form are derived. We also considered methods to account for missing data patterns. These methods are applied to CD4 data from a randomized clinical trial of AIDS patients where half of the patients were randomized to receive Zidovudine (ZDV) and the other half were randomized to receive a placebo. Although a strong correlation between CD4 counts and survival is demonstrated, we also show that CD4 counts may not serve as a useful surrogate marker for assessing treatments for this population of patients.},

Dispersal standard deviations were estimated at 22.9 km for the house sparrows and ranged from 0.66 to 4.4 km for the tits. Female great tits and blue tits dispersed consistently further than males. Estimates of the shape parameter of the dispersal distribution ranged from 0.66 to 2.27, indicating strong to moderately leptokurtic dispersal displacements. There were significant effects of density on local immigration rates and a consistent tendency for immigration rates to depend underproportionally on local densities. Potential implications of the shape of the dispersal distribution for the spread of invading organisms were investigated and compared with previous results. It is shown that the wave speed, for a given dispersal standard deviation, depends only to some extent on leptokurtosis, provided that the intrinsic growth rate of the population is moderate or small. In estimating the dispersal standard deviation, however, incorrect assumptions about the degree of leptokurtosis can lead to a large bias in estimation and predictions.},

Each analysis assumes an additive polygenic trait with n diallelic loci under stabilizing selection. We allow loci to have different effects and consider equilibria at which the population mean departs from the stabilizing-selection optimum. Under weak selection, each model produces essentially identical, approximate allele-frequency dynamics. Variation is maintained under pleiotropic balancing selection only at loci for which the strength of balancing selection exceeds the effective strength of stabilizing selection. In addition, for all models, polymorphism requires that the population mean be close enough to the optimum that directional selection does not overwhelm balancing selection. This balance allows many simultaneously stable equilibria, and we explore their properties numerically. Both spatial and temporal G X E can maintain variation at loci for which the coefficient of variation (across environments) of the effect of a substitution exceeds a critical value greater than one. The critical value depends on the correlation between substitution effects at different loci. For large positive correlations (e.g., p(ij)(2) > 3/4), even extreme fluctuations in allelic effects cannot maintain variation. Surprisingly, this constraint on correlations implies that sex-dependent allelic effects cannot maintain polygenic variation. We present numerical results that support our analytical approximations and discuss our results in connection to relevant data and alternative variance- maintaining mechanisms.},

   Abstract = {Sexual selection models usually predict directional selection for ornamental traits because of intra- as well as inter-sexual selection. Animals frequently face reproductive trade-offs, such as between mating and parental effort. Provided that both are essential and have opposite effects on ornament expression, we may however not necessarily expect directional selection for ornament size. The house sparrow is an ideal species to study such a trade-off, as the size of the male ornament, the black throat badge, seems to be inversely related to mating and parental effort. It has been suggested that large-badged males invest more in female attraction and territory defence, while small-badged males may invest more in parental care. In a nest- box study, we show that females started to breed earliest and produced the largest clutches when mated to males with average- sized badges that invested in paternal care more than other males. These results are discussed in view of inter- as well intra-sexual selection. Overall, average-badged males experienced the highest hatching failures, their chicks were in the poorest physical condition and they did not fledge more chicks than other males. It is therefore unlikely that the mating advantages that we observed could by themselves lead to stabilizing selection for badge size. Our results rather suggest that badge size in male house sparrows signals different reproductive tactics, which are adapted flexibly according to their physical condition and socio-ecological situations.},

In the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, extra- group copulations (EGCs) occur frequently, but are not accompanied by sexual courtship displays as in within-pair copulations. Paternity is nearly always gained by primary males. We investigated whether T levels and sperm storage capability (cloacal protuberance (CP)) in adult primary and subordinate males were related to timing of egg laying, levels of cuckoldry and extra-group paternity (EGP) opportunities. During the sexually active period before egg laying, T levels and CP were only elevated or enlarged (respectively) in primary males, and some suggestion was found that subordinate males do not invest in elevated T levels. The peak in T occurred during the fertile period of the female partner and corresponded to the peak period of male sexual displays and mate guarding, but was independent of cuckoldry risk (density of neighbouring primary males). CP was also enhanced during this period; however, CP but not T remained elevated after egg laying by their mates, and CP but not T was positively related to EGP opportunities (density of neighbouring fertile females). We conclude that T is involved in sexual courtship displays and mate guarding, but not in gaining EGCs. These findings contrast with those in other species where EGP involves elaborate sexual displays.},

These typical reactions, described as personalities or coping strategies, have a clear genetic basis, but the structure of their inheritance in natural populations is almost unknown. We carried out a quantitative genetic analysis of two personality traits (exploration and boldness) and the combination of these two traits (early exploratory behaviour). This study was carried out on the lines resulting from a two-directional artificial selection experiment on early exploratory behaviour (EEB) of great tits (Parus major) originating from a wild population. In analyses using the original lines, reciprocal F- 1 and reciprocal first backcross generations, additive, dominance, maternal effects ands sex-dependent expression of exploration, boldness and EEB were estimated. Both additive and dominant genetic effects were important determinants of phenotypic variation in exploratory behaviour and boldness. However, no sex-dependent expression was observed in either of these personality traits. These results are discussed with respect to the maintenance of genetic variation in personality traits, and the expected genetic structure of other behavioural and life history traits in general.},

   Pages = {666-679},
   Abstract = {Multivariate selection models and demographic matrix projections are closely related. The subtle differences among the parameters of both approaches (sensitivities, elasticities, selection differentials, and gradients) can be confusing. I suggest a hierarchical framework for analysis using elasticity path diagrams, "elastograms." The framework combines selection analysis fur the links between phenotypic traits (morphology, behavior) and fitness components (vital rates) with matrix analysis for the relationship between fitness components and population growth rate/fitness. Elasticities are often used to quantify the impact of a transition rate in the projection matrix on the population growth rate (lambda). Elasticities fur underlying fitness components such as fecundity and survival rates can be derived from their connection with the transition matrix entries. Yet other traits may affect lambda due to a functional relationship with one or more components of fitness: for instance, the timing of flowering of a plant may affect its seed yield. Elasticities can also be used to quantity the effects of such traits: they can be interpreted as selection gradients for traits expressed on a proportional (mean-standardized) scale. "Evolvabilities" (additive genetic variation in mean-standardized traits), rather than the heritabilities of traits, are needed to predict expected selection responses from the elasticities. Elasticities quantify the direct effect of a focal trait on lambda. integrated elasticities measure the impact of a trait through both its direct and indirect effects. This requires knowledge of the correlations among traits. Matrix projections and selection analysis (through multiple regression or path analysis) can be merged into an elasticity path diagram that summarizes the hierarchical relationships among traits and fitness. Such diagrams facilitate the identification of those traits that have the highest impact on the life cycle of the study organism and can be a tool to define the targets of management practices, as well as an aid in comparative life history research.},

Males of the sexually dichromatic house sparrow, Passer domesticus, have a black throat patch that functions as a badge of status. I investigated whether badge size honestly shows phenotypic quality. Badge size increases with age and decreases with advancing hedging date in yearling males; thus, badge size was larger in older individuals even though age differences were small. Badge size also increased with physical condition independent of age. These results indicate that badge size functions as an honest signal, possibly because there are costs involved in its production. I also found that males with enlarged badges acquired more nest sites than either control males or males with reduced badges. However, males with enlarged badges possessing a nest site raised fewer fledglings per year than did males with reduced badges, suggesting that cheating has no selective benefit. Further studies that accurately measure the energy expenditure allocated to badge production and that quantify additional fitness components are needed to clarify how reliable badges are maintained.},

It has generally been assumed that these called 'badges' are inexpensive to produce, so other kind of costs have been invoked to explain how they are maintained as honest signals. In the present study we addressed the hypothesis that the black throat badge of male house sparrows functions as an honest signal of condition because it is nutritionally costly to produce, a possibility not yet evaluated for badges showing status. While under field conditions adult birds exhibited larger badges than juveniles, individuals of both age classes developed badges of similar size when moulting in an aviary with ad libitum food. Fat reserves, blood proteins and body mass records of free ranging birds at the start of moult suggest that juveniles were in poorer condition than adults. The reduction of blood proteins during moult negatively correlated with badge size after moult in juveniles but not in adults, and only the variation of blood proteins, but not fat reserves, correlated with the size of the badge when using multiple regression analysis. The results suggest that: (i) a limited access to food sources during moult may account for the smaller badge size of juveniles as previously reported in the same study population; and (ii) the use of more blood proteins: that seems to depend on a worse nutritional condition, constrains the production of a larger badge. The results give support for the hypothesis that badges are costly to produce, though the magnitude of the costs may be age dependent.},

Our results indicate that the size distribution is strongly asymmetrical, with a much higher proportion of small than large fragments, that it is not influenced by the number of selective nucleotides nor by genome size but that it may vary with genome-wide GC-content, with a higher proportion of small fragments in cases of lower GC-content when considering the standard AFLP protocol with the enzyme MseI. Results from population samples of the two plant species show that there is a negative relationship between AFLP fragment size and fragment population frequency. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that size homoplasy, arising from pulling together nonhomologous fragments of the same size, generates patterns similar to those observed in P. lunatus and L. perenne because of the asymmetry of the size distribution. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of estimating genetic diversity with AFLP markers.},

   Abstract = {In designed experiments and in particular longitudinal studies, the aim may be to assess the effect of a quantitative variable such as time on treatment effects. Modelling treatment effects can be complex in the presence of other sources of variation. Three examples are presented to illustrate an approach to analysis in such cases. The first example is a longitudinal experiment on the growth of cows under a factorial treatment structure where serial correlation and variance heterogeneity complicate the analysis. The second example involves the calibration of optical density and the concentration of a protein DNase in the presence of sampling variation and variance heterogeneity. The final example is a multienvironment agricultural field experiment in which a yield-seeding rate relationship is required for several varieties of lupins. Spatial variation within environments, heterogeneity between environments and variation between varieties all need to be incorporated in the analysis. In this paper, the cubic smoothing spline is used in conjunction with fixed and random effects, random coefficients and variance modelling to provide simultaneous modelling of trends and covariance structure. The key result that allows coherent and flexible empirical model building in complex situations is the linear mixed model representation of the cubic smoothing spline. An extension is proposed in which trend is partitioned into smooth and nonsmooth components. Estimation and inference, the analysis of the three examples and a discussion of extensions and unresolved issues are also presented.},

   Abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

   Abstract = {The importance of dispersal for population genetics, population dynamics, and conservation biology is well established. We studied natal dispersal of Great Tits between Wytham Wood (high-quality habitat), and hedgerows and small woodlands within 2 km of Wytham Wood (the ''surrounding area''; low- quality habitat). We (1) quantified the exchange of birds between these habitats, and (2) evaluated whether there was phenotypic variation between dispersing and philopatric birds. Only 6% of immigrants in Wytham were born in the surrounding area, and only 5% of emigrant recruits from Wytham bred in the surrounding area. This indicates that most nonphilopatric birds dispersed >2 km, considerably farther than expected. The effect of sex on dispersal depends on the scale on which it is studied: females dispersed longer distances than males, but the exchange of birds between woodlands was not sex biased. The proportion of immigrants among breeding birds was similar for both sexes, confirming the latter result. Dispersing and philopatric birds did not differ in hatch date, but birds that hatched in the surrounding area and dispersed into Wytham had greater nestling mass than those that did not. This effect was not found in Wytham, suggesting that there is an interaction between phenotypic quality and habitat quality with respect to dispersal: birds of high phenotypic quality disperse when they are born in low-quality habitat. As a result, birds breeding in Wytham (high-quality) had greater mass as nestlings than birds breeding in the surrounding area (low-quality). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that conditions during early development have an affect on the quality of the environment in which a bird subsequently reproduces.},

   Abstract = {Females often select their mates on the basis of the size or intensity of sexual ornaments, and it is thought that such traits are reliable indicators of male quality because the costliness of these traits prevents cheating. The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis is a recently proposed mechanistic explanation of these costs and states that males carry ornaments at the expense of their resistance to disease and parasites. The tradeoff between immunocompetence and sexual ornamentation was hypothesized to arise as a consequence of the dual effect of androgens on ornamentation (+) and immune function (-). To test this hypothesis, we compared comb size between male domestic chickens Gallus domesticus of lines divergently selected for antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes (three lines: selected for low response or high response and a control line). The importance of comb size in inter- and intrasexual selection is well established, and comb size is strongly dependent on testosterone level. Comb size was larger in the males of the low line than in the high line, and comb size of control males was intermediate, indicating a tradeoff between ornamentation and immunocompetence. Testosterone (T) levels varied in a similar fashion (T-Low > T- Control > T-High), suggesting that this hormone could mediate the tradeoff between ornamentation and immunocompetence. These results support the idea that a tradeoff with immune function may constrain the expression of secondary sexual ornaments.},

Individuals should therefore start reproduction in response to cues (the proximate factors), available in the environment of reproductive decision making, which predict the later environment of selection. With increasing spring temperatures over the past decades, vegetation phenology has advanced, with a concomitant advancement in the reproduction of some species at higher trophic levels. However, a mismatch between food abundance and offspring needs may occur if changes in the environment of decision making do not match those in the environment of selection. Date of egg laying in a great tit (Parus major) population has not advanced over a 23-year period, but selection for early laying has intensified. We believe that this is the first documented case of an adaptive response being hampered because a changing abiotic factor affects the environment in which a reproductive decision is made differently from the environment in which selection occurs.},

The outstanding question is whether these responses match the temperature-induced shift of the selection pressures acting on these organisms. Organisms have evolved response mechanisms that are only adaptive given the existing, relationship between the cues organisms use and the selection pressures acting on them. Global warming may disrupt ecosystem interactions because it alters these relationships and micro-evolution may be slow in tracking these changes. In particular, such shifts have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning for the tight multitrophic interactions involved in the timing of reproduction and growth. We determined the response of winter moth (Operophtera brumata) egg hatching and oak (Quercus robur) bud burst to temperature, a system with strong selection on synchronization. We show that there has been poor synchrony in recent warm springs, which is due to an increase in spring temperatures without a decrease in the incidence of freezing spells in winter. This is a clear warning that such changes in temperature patterns may affect ecosystem interactions more strongly than changes in mean temperature.},

   Pages = {649-659},
   Abstract = {The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing environment. If we establish the maximal rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to the rate at which temperatures can increase without loss of biodiversity. The rate of adaptation will primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii) learning will be favourable to the individual but cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii) maternal effects may play a role but, as with other forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv) adaptation via immigration of individuals with genotypes adapted to warmer environments also involves microevolution as these genotypes are better adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of, for instance, photoperiod. Long-term studies on wild populations with individually known animals play an essential role in detecting and understanding the temporal trends in life-history traits, and to estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures on, life-history traits. However, additional measurements on other trophic levels and on the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are needed to predict the rate of microevolution, especially under changing conditions. Using this knowledge on heritability of, and selection on, life-history traits, in combination with climate scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to make the link to population viability and from there to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the rate of adaptation is insufficient.},

House sparrow nests where the male had been trapped and banded were observed for 1 h on at least 5 d during the peak growth period of nestlings. Male feeding shares measured as the proportion of total feeds per chick made by the male, were marginally positively correlated with male badge size. Moreover, higher male shares of nestling feeding were associated with improved prospects for offspring survival, and a greater proportion of chicks edged from the nests of larger-badged males. These results suggest that females paired to large-badged males gain direct benefits in the form of enhanced nestling survival, which presumably stem from factors associated with increases in the proportion of nestling feeding contributed by their mates.},

   Abstract = {Longitudinal studies often gather joint information on time to some event (survival analysis, time to dropout) and serial outcome measures (repeated measures, growth curves). Depending on the purpose of the study, one may wish to estimate and compare serial trends over time while accounting for possibly non-ignorable dropout or one may wish to investigate any associations that may exist between the event time of interest and various longitudinal trends. In this paper, we consider a class of randomeffects models known as shared parameter models that are particularly useful for jointly analysing such data; namely repeated measurements and event time data. Specific attention will be given to the longitudinal setting where the primary goal is to estimate and compare serial trends over time while adjusting for possible informative censoring due to patient dropout. Parametric and semi-parametric survival models for event times together with generalized linear or non-linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements are proposed for jointly modelling serial outcome rneasures and event times. Methods of estimation are based on a generalized non-linear mixed-effects model that may be easily implemented using existing software. This approach allows for flexible modelling of both the distribution of event times and of the relationship of the longitudinal response variable to the event time of interest. The model and methods are illustrated using data from a multi-centre study of the effects of diet and blood pressure control on progression of renal disease, the modification of diet in renal disease study.

   Abstract = {There is a growing body of data on avian eyes, including measurements of visual pigment and oil droplet spectral absorption, and of receptor densities and their distributions across the retina. These data are sufficient to predict psychophysical colour discrimination thresholds for light- adapted eyes, and hence provide a basis for relating eye design to visual needs. We examine the advantages of coloured oil droplets, UV vision and tetrachromacy for discriminating a diverse set of avian plumage spectra under natural illumination. Discriminability is enhanced both by tetrachromacy and coloured oil droplets. Oil droplets may also improve colour constancy. Comparison of the performance of a pigeon's eye, where the shortest wavelength receptor peak is at 410 nm, with that of the passerine Leiothrix, where the ultraviolet-sensitive peak is at 365 nm, generally shows a small advantage to the latter, but this advantage depends critically on the noise level in the sensitivity mechanism and on the set of spectra being viewed.},

The quantum catches were then coded by "red," "green," and "blue" of a computer monitor; and powers, birds, and fish were visualized in "animal colours. " Calculations were performed for different illumination conditions. To simulate colour constancy, we used a von Kries algorithm, i.e., the receptor quantum catches were scaled so that the colour of illumination remained invariant. We show that on land this algorithm compensates reasonably well for changes of object appearance caused by natural changes of illumination, while in water failures of von Kries colour constancy are prominent.

To understand why coloured oil droplets appeared and were retained during evolution, I consider both the benefits and the costs of light filtering in the retina. Oil droplets decrease cone quantum catch and reduce the overlap in sensitivity between spectrally adjacent cones. The reduction of spectral overlap increases the volume occupied by object colours in a cone space, whereas the decrease in quantum catch increases noise, and thus reduces the discriminability of similar colours. The trade-off between these two effects determines the total benefit of oil droplets. Calculations show that coloured oil droplets increase the number of object colours that can be discriminated, and thus are beneficial for colour vision.},

   Abstract = {Although epistasis is at the center of the Fisher-Wright debate, biologists not involved in the controversy are often unaware that there are actually two different formal definitions of epistasis. We compare concepts of genetic independence in the two theoretical traditions of evolutionary genetics, population genetics and quantitative genetics, and show how independence of gene action (represented by the multiplicative model of population genetics) can be different from the absence of gene interaction (represented by the linear additive model of quantitative genetics). The two formulations converge with weak selection but not with strong selection or, for multiple loci, when the aggregated interaction terms are not negligible. As a result of the different formulations of gene interaction,the presence or absence of linkage disequilibrium, D, does not necessarily indicate the presence or absence of fitness epistasis. Indeed, linkage disequilibrium is generated in 'additive' models in quantitative genetics whenever two (or more) loci experience simultaneous selection. As a research strategy, it is often practical, for theoretical or experimental reasons,to minimize gene interaction by assuming independence of gene action in regard to fitness, or by assuming linear additive effects of multiple loci on a phenotype. However, minimizing the role of epistasis in theoretical investigations hinders our understanding of the origins of diversity and the evolution of complex phenotypes.},

   Abstract = {Likelihood methods have been developed to partition individuals in a sample into full-sib and half-sib families using genetic marker data without parental information. They invariably make the critical assumption that marker data are free of genotyping errors and mutations and are thus completely reliable in inferring sibships. Unfortunately, however, this assumption is rarely tenable for virtually all kinds of genetic markers in practical use and, if violated, can severely bias sibship estimates as shown by simulations in this article. I propose a new likelihood method With simple and robust models of typing error incorporated into it. Simulations show that the new method call be used to infer full- and half-sibships accurately from marker data with a high error rate and to identify typing errors at each locus in each reconstructed sib family. The new method also improves previous ones by adopting a Fresh iterative procedure for updating allele frequencies with reconstructed sibships taken into account, by allowing for the use of parental information, and by using efficient algorithms for calculating the likelihood function and searching for the maximum-likelihood configuration. It is tested extensively oil simulated data with a varying number of marker loci, different rates of typing errors, and various sample sizes and family structures and applied to two empirical data sets to demonstrate its usefulness.},

   Abstract = {Knowledge of the genetic relatedness between a pair of individuals is important in many research areas of quantitative genetics, conservation genetics, evolution and ecology. Many estimators have been developed to estimate such pairwise relatedness (r) using codominant markers, such as microsatellites and enzymes. In contrast, only two estimators are proposed to use dominant markers, such as random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), in relatedness inference. They are both biased estimators, and their statistical properties and robustness to the sampling errors in allele frequency have not been investigated. In this short paper, I propose two new pairwise relatedness estimators for dominant markers, and compare them in precision, accuracy and robustness to sampling with the two previous estimators using simulations. It was found that the new estimator based on the least squares approach is unbiased when allele frequencies are known or estimated from a sample without correcting for sampling effects. It has, however, a low precision and as a result, an intermediate overall performance among the four estimators in terms of the mean squared deviation (MSD) of estimates from actual values of r. The new estimator based on a similarity index is slightly biased but has generally the lowest MSD among the four estimators compared, regardless of the number of loci, type of actual relationships, allele frequencies known or estimated from samples. Simulations also show that the confidence intervals estimated by bootstrapping are appropriate for different estimators provided that the number of loci used in the estimation is not small.},

   Abstract = {Parentage exclusion probabilities are now routinely calculated in genetic marker-assisted parentage analyses to indicate the statistical power of the analyses achievable for a given set of markers, and to measure the informativeness of a set of markers for parentage inference. Previous formulas invariably assume that parentage is to be sought for a single offspring, while in practice multiple full siblings might be sampled (for example, seeds, eggs or young from a pair of monogamous parents) and their father, mother or both are to be assigned among a number of candidates. In this study, I derive formulas for parentage exclusion probabilities for an arbitrary number (n) of fullsibs, which reduce to previous equations for the special case of n = 1. I also derive sibship exclusion probabilities, and investigate the power of differentiating half-sib, avuncular and grandparent-grandoffspring relationships using unlinked autosomal markers among different numbers of tested individuals. Applications of the formulas are demonstrated using both theoretical and empirical data sets of allele frequencies. The results from the study highlight the conclusion that the power of genealogical relationship inferences can be enhanced enormously by analysing multiple individuals for a given set of markers. The equations derived in this study allow more accurate determination of marker information and of the power of a parentage/sibship analysis. In addition, they can be used to guide experimental designs of parentage analyses in selecting markers and determining the number of offspring to be sampled and genotyped.},

We apply these methods to data from 20 morphospecies of Pleistocene planktic Foraminifera in order to estimate ancestral size and shape variables, and compare these estimates with measurements on fossils close to the phylogenetic position of 13 ancestors. No method produced accurate estimates for any variable: estimates were consistently less good as predictors of the observed values than were the averages of the observed values. The two-parameter maximum-likelihood model consistently produces the most accurate size estimates overall. Estimation of ancestral sizes is confounded by an evolutionary trend towards increasing size. Shape showed no trend but was still estimated very poorly: we consider possible reasons. We discuss the implications of our results for the use of estimates of ancestral characteristics.},

The results indicate that 84% of field heritabilities are significantly different from zero and that for morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits there are no significant differences between laboratory and field estimates of heritability. Unexpectedly, mean heritabilities for morphological and life-history traits are actually higher in the field than in the lab. Twenty-two cases were found for which both laboratory and natural heritabilities had been estimated on the same traits. For this subset of the data, laboratory heritabilities tended to be higher than field estimates, but the difference was not significant. Also, the correlation between lab and field estimates was high (r = 0.6, P < 0.001), and the regression slope did not differ significantly from one.

Based on analysis of sex ratio skews in birds and wasps, we show that (i) mechanisms of sex determination do not necessarily constrain the evolution of sex ratio adjustment, and (ii) parental ability to predict their offsprings' environment influences the evolution of sex ratio patterns across taxa. More generally, our results show that multiple constraints may determine the precision of adaptation.},

First, we compared estimates of population structure (Q(st)) for seven phenotypic characters with the corresponding measures for allozyme markers (F-st) to evaluate the supposition that genetic drift is a major determinant of the evolutionary history of this species. Secondly, we compared the genetic (co) variance (G) matrices of five populations to examine whether a long history of population isolation is associated with large, consistent differences in the genetic (co) variance structure. Differences between estimates of Fst and Qst were too small to be declared significant, indicating that stochastic processes have played a major role in the structuring of quantitative variation in this species. Comparison of populations using the common principal component (CPC) method rejected the hypothesis that the G matrices differed by a simple constant of proportionality: most of the variation involved principal component structure rather than the eigenvalues. However, there was strong evidence for proportionality in comparisons using the method of percentage reduction in mean-square error (MSE), at least when characters with unusually high (co) variance estimates were included in the analyses. Although the CPC and MSE methods provide different, but complementary, views of G matrix variation, we urge caution in the use of proportionality as an indicator of whether genetic drift is responsible for divergence in the G matrix.},

   Abstract = {The genetic covariance and correlation matrices for five morphological traits were estimated from four populations of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, to measure the extent of change in genetic covariances as a result of directional selection. Two of the populations were derived from lines that had undergone selection for large or small thorax length over the preceding 23 generations. A third population was constituted using flies from control lines that were maintained with equivalent population sizes as the selected lines. The fourth population contained flies from the original cage population from which the selected and control lines had been started. Tests of the homogeneity of covariance matrices using maximum likelihood techniques revealed significant changes in covariance structure among the selected lines. Prediction of base population trait means from selected line means under the assumption of constant genetic covariances indicated that genetic covariances for the small population differed more from the base population than did the covariances for the large population. The predicted small population means diverged farther from the expected means because the additive genetic variance associated with several traits increased in value and most of the genetic covariances associated with one trait changed in sign. These results illustrate that genetic covariances may remain nearly constant in some situations while changing markedly in others. Possible developmental reasons for the genetic changes are discussed.},

   Abstract = {Heritable maternal effects have important consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic traits under selection, but have only rarely been tested for or quantified in evolutionary studies. Here we estimate maternal effects on early-life traits in a feral population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) from St Kilda, Scotland. We then partition the maternal effects into genetic and environmental components to obtain the first direct estimates of maternal genetic effects in a free-living population, and furthermore test for covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects. Using an animal model approach, direct heritabilities (h(2)) were low but maternal genetic effects (m(2)) represented a relatively large proportion of the total phenotypic variance for each trait (birth weight m(2) = 0.119, birth date m(2) = 0.197, natal litter size m(2) = 0.211). A negative correlation between direct and maternal genetic effects was estimated for each trait, but was only statistically significant for natal litter size (r(am) = - 0.714). Total heritabilities (incorporating variance from heritable maternal effects and the direct-maternal genetic covariance) were significant for birth weight and birth date but not for natal litter size. Inadequately specified models greatly overestimated additive genetic variance and hence direct h(2) (by a factor of up to 6.45 in the case of birth date). We conclude that failure to model heritable maternal variance can result in over- or under-estimation of the potential for traits to respond to selection, and advocate an increased effort to explicitly measure maternal genetic effects in evolutionary studies.},

We examined selection regimes on the correlated traits of birth weight, birth date, and litter size in Soay sheep (Ovis aries) using data from a long-term study of a free-living population on the archipelago of St. Kilda, Scotland. We tested the hypothesis that selective constraints on the evolution of the multivariate phenotype arise through antagonistic selection, either acting at offspring and maternal levels, or on correlated aspects of phenotype. All three traits were found to be under selection through variance in short-term and lifetime measures of fitness. Analysis of lifetime fitness revealed strong positive directional selection on birth weight and weaker selection for increased birth date at both levels. However, there was also evidence for stabilizing selection on these traits at the maternal level, with reduced fitness at high phenotypic values indicating lower phenotypic optima for mothers than for offspring. Additionally, antagonistic selection was found on litter size. From the offspring's point of view it is better to be born a singleton, whereas maternal fitness increases with average litter size. The decreased fitness of twins is caused by their reduced birth weight; therefore, this antagonistic selection likely results from trade-offs between litter size and birth weight that have different optimal resolutions with respect to offspring and maternal fitness. Our results highlight how selection regimes may vary depending on the assignment of reproductive and early life-history traits to either offspring or maternal phenotype.},

Levels of heritable (and nonheritable) variation might change over ontogeny, increasing through "variance compounding" or decreasing through "compensatory growth." We test for these processes using a meta-analysis of age-specific weight traits in domestic ungulates. Generally, mean standardized variance components decrease with age, consistent with compensatory growth. Phenotypic convergence among adult sheep occurs through decreasing environmental and maternal genetic variation. Maternal variation similarly declines in cattle. Maternal genetic effects are thus reduced with age (both in absolute and relative terms). Significant trends in heritability (decreasing in cattle, increasing in sheep) result from declining maternal and environmental components rather than from changing additive variation. There was no evidence for increasing standardized variance components. Any compounding must therefore be masked by more important compensatory processes. While extrapolation of these patterns to processes in natural population is difficult, our results highlight the inadequacy of assuming constancy in genetic parameters over ontogeny. Negative covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects was common. Negative correlations with additive and maternal genetic variances indicate that antagonistic pleiotropy (between additive and maternal genetic effects) may maintain genetic variance and limit responses to selection.},

We performed quantitative genetic analyses of weight and hindleg length in a free-living population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) to test whether genetic constraints can explain previously reported stasis in body size despite evidence for strong positive directional selection. Genetic, maternal and environmental covariance structures were estimated across ontogeny using random regression animal models. Heritability increased with age for weight and hindleg length, though both measures of size were highly heritable across ontogeny. Genetic correlations among ages were generally strong and uniformly positive, and the covariance structures were also highly integrated across ontogeny. Consequently, we found no constraint to the evolution of larger size itself. Rather we expect size at all ages to increase in response to positive selection acting at any age. Consistent with expectation, predicted breeding values for age-specific size traits have increased over a twenty-year period, while maternal performance for offspring size has declined. Re-examination of the phenotypic data confirmed that sheep are not getting larger, but also showed that there are significant negative trends in size at all ages. The genetic evolution is therefore cryptic, with the response to selection presumably being masked at the phenotypic level by a plastic response to changing environmental conditions. Density-dependence, coupled with systematically increasing population size, may contribute to declining body size but is insufficient to completely explain it. Our results demonstrate that an increased understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and of how plasticity and microevolution can occur simultaneously, is necessary for developing predictive models of phenotypic change in nature.},

Data from long-term ecological studies is increasingly allowing quantitative genetic approaches to be used in studies of senescence in free-living populations of vertebrates. We review work to date and argue that the patterns are broadly consistent with theoretical predictions, although there is also a clear need for more empirical work. 3. We argue that further advances in this field of research might be facilitated by increased use of reaction norm models, and a decreased emphasis on attempting to discriminate between mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy models of senescence. We also suggest a framework for the better integration of environmental and genetic effects on ageing. 4. Finally, we discuss some of the difficulties in applying quantitative genetic models to studies of senescence outside the laboratory.

We present a model with three quantitative traits: male and female parental investment and a potential male indicator trait. In our model, the expression of the ''indicator'' trail in offspring is affected by parental investment. These effects are referred to as maternal or paternal effects, or as ''indirect genetic effects'' when parental investment is heritable. With genetic variation for degree of parental investment, offspring harbor genes for parental investment that an unexpressed before mating but will affect the investment that they provide when expressed. Because the in vestment received from the parents affects the expression of the indicator trait, there will be a correlation between the genes fur parental investment inherited and the degree of expression of the indicator trail in the offspring. The indicator trait is thus an ''honest'' signal for the degree of paternal investment.},

   Abstract = {Parents often have important influences on their offspring's traits and/or fitness (i.e., maternal or paternal effects). When offspring fitness is determined by the joint influences of offspring and parental traits, selection may favor particular combinations that generate high offspring fitness. We show that this epistasis for fitness between the parental and offspring genotypes can result in the evolution of their joint distribution, generating genetic correlations between the parental and offspring characters. This phenomenon can be viewed as a coadaptive process in which offspring genotypes evolve to function with the parentally provided environment and, in turn, the genes for this environment become associated with specific offspring genes adapted to it. To illustrate this point, we present two scenarios in which selection on offspring alone alters the correlation between a maternal and an offspring character. We use a quantitative genetic maternal effect model combined with a simple quadratic model of fitness to examine changes in the linkage disequilibrium between the maternal and offspring genotypes. In the first scenario, stabilizing selection on a maternally affected offspring character results in a genetic correlation that is opposite in sign to the maternal effect. In the second scenario, directional selection on an offspring trait that shows a nonadditive maternal effect can result in selection for positive covariances between the traits. This form of selection also results in increased genetic variation in maternal and offspring characters, and may, in the extreme case, promote host-race formation or speciation. This model provides a possible evolutionary explanation for the ubiquity of large genetic correlations between maternal and offspring traits, and suggests that this pattern of coinheritance may reflect functional relationships between these characters (i.e., functional integration).},

We allow female choice of males based on this parentally affected trait and examine the evolution of mate choice, parental quality and the indicator trait. Our model reveals a number of consequences of maternal and paternal effects. (1) The force of sexual selection owing to adaptive mate choice can displace parental quality from its natural selection optimum. (2) The force of sexual selection can displace female parental quality from its natural selection optimum even when nonadaptive mate choice occurs (e.g. runaway sexual selection), because females of higher parental quality produce more attractive sons and these sons counterbalance the loss in fitness owing to over-investment in each offspring. (3) Maternal and paternal effects can provide a source of genetic variation for offspring traits, allowing evolution by sexual selection even when those trails do not show direct genetic variation (i.e. are not heritable). (4) The correlation between paternal investment and the offspring trait influenced by the parental effects can result in adaptive mate choice and lead to the elaboration of both female preference and the male sexually selected trait. When parental effects exist, sexual selection can drive the evolution of parental quality when investment increases the attractiveness of offspring, leading to the elaboration of indicator traits and higher than expected levels of parental investment.},

   Abstract = {Social interactions often affect the fitness of interactants. Because of this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our model of social selection is analogous to covariance model of other forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes, which promotes social selection. The independent force of social selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide insights into social evolution.},

These analyses generally assume that an individual's genes map directly to its phenotype and epistasis results from interactions among loci that contribute to the same biochemical or developmental pathways (termed physiological, or within-genotype, epistasis). For many characters, particularly those expressed early in life, an individual's phenotype may also be affected by genes expressed by its parents. The presence of these parental effects allows for interactions between the genes present in the parental and offspring genomes. When the phenotypic effect of a locus in the offspring depends on the alleles possessed by its parents, genotype-by-genotype. or among-genotype, epistasis occurs. The among-genotype epistasis resulting from parental effects may contribute to ruggedness of adaptive landscapes because early mortality often accounts for much of the variance in fitness in populations. To demonstrate how parent-offspring interactions can result in among-genotype epistasis, I use a two-locus model, with one maternal effect locus and one direct effect locus, each with two alleles. Dynamical equations are presented for the two-locus model and are directly contrasted with the dynamical equations derived for a model for physiological epistasis. The relationship between the evolutionary dynamics resulting from these two forms of epistasis is discussed. Three scenarios are presented to illustrate systems in which maternal-offspring, genotype-by-genotype epistasis may occur.

Understanding the developmental basis of quantitative traits may lead to insights into the origin and evolution of quantitative genetic variation, the evolutionary fate of populations, and, more generally, the relationship between development and evolution. Herein, we assume a hierarchical, modular structure of trait development and consider how epigenetic interactions among modules during ontogeny affect patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation. We explore two developmental models, one in which the epigenetic interactions between modules result in additive effects on character expression and a second model in which these epigenetic interactions produce nonadditive effects. Using a phenotype landscape approach, we show how changes in the developmental processes underlying phenotypic expression can alter the magnitude and pattern of quantitative genetic variation. Additive epigenetic effects influence genetic variances and covariances, but allow trait means to evolve independently of the genetic variances and covariances, so that phenotypic evolution can proceed without changing the genetic covariance structure that determines future evolutionary response. Nonadditive epigenetic effects, however, can lead to evolution of genetic variances and covariances as the mean phenotype evolves. Our model suggests that an understanding of multivariate evolution can be considerably enriched by knowledge of the mechanistic basis of character development.},

The benefits and risks inherent in assigning fitness of offspring to parents have been given primarily as verbal arguments and no explicit theoretical analyses have examined quantitatively how the assignment of fitness can affect evolutionary inferences. Using a simple quantitative genetic model, we contrast the conclusions drawn about how selection acts on a maternal character when components of offspring fitness (such as early survival) are assigned to parents vs. when they are assigned directly to the individual offspring. We find that there are potential shortcomings of both possible assignments of fitness. In general, whenever there is a genetic correlation between the parental and direct effects on offspring fitness, assigning components of offspring fitness to parents yields incorrect dynamical equations and may even lead to incorrect conclusions about the direction of evolution. Assignment of offspring fitness to parents may also produce incorrect estimates of selection whenever environmental variation contributes to variance of the maternal trait. Whereas assignment of offspring fitness to the offspring avoids these potential problems, it introduces the possible problem of missing components of kin selection provided by the mother, which may not be detected in selection analyses. There are also certain conditions where either model can be appropriate because assignment of offspring fitness to parents may yield the same dynamical equations assigning offspring fitness directly to offspring. We discuss these implications of the alternative assignments of fitness for modelling, selection analysis and experimentation in evolutionary biology.},

Although these social effects on fitness and trait expression may appear to be purely environmental, they differ from other sorts of environmental influences, because they can have a genetic basis and thus can contribute to evolution. Theory has shown that these effects modify the definition of genetic architecture by making the phenotype the property of the genotypes of multiple individuals and alter evolutionary dynamics by introducing additional heritable components contributing to trait evolution. These effects suggest that genetic and evolutionary analyses of traits influenced by social environments must incorporate the genetic components of variation contributed by these environments. However, empirical studies incorporating these effects are generally lacking. In this paper, I quantify the contribution of genetically based environmental effects arising from social interactions during group rearing to the quantitative genetics of body size in Drosophila melanogaster. The results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of body size contains an important component of variation contributed by the social environment, which is hidden to ordinary genetic analyses and opposes the direct effects of genes on body-size development within a population. Using a model of trait evolution, I show that these effects significantly alter evolutionary predictions by providing hidden constraints on phenotypic evolution. The importance of relatedness of interactants and the potential impact of kin selection on the evolution of body size are also examined.},

   Abstract = {Resource allocation within individuals may often be hierarchical, and this may have important effects on genetic correlations and on trait evolution. For example, organisms may divide energy between reproduction and somatic growth and then subdivide reproductive resources. Genetic variation in allocation to pathways early in such hierarchies (e. g., reproduction) can cause positive genetic correlations between traits that trade off (e. g., offspring size and number) because some individuals invest more resources in reproduction than others. We used quantitative-genetic models to explore the evolutionary implications of allocation hierarchies. Our results showed that when variation in allocation early in the hierarchy exceeds subsequent variation in allocation, genetic covariances and initial responses to selection do not reflect trade-offs occurring at later levels in the hierarchy. This general pattern was evident for many starting allocations and optima and for whether traits contributed multiplicatively or additively to fitness. Finally, artificial selection on a single trait revealed masked trade-offs when variation in early allocation was comparable to subsequent variation in allocation. This result confirms artificial selection as a powerful, but not foolproof, method of detecting trade-offs. Thus, allocation hierarchies can profoundly affect life-history evolution by causing traits to evolve in the opposite direction to that predicted by trade-offs.},

   Abstract = {The logistic or S-shaped curve of growth is one of the few universal laws in biology. It is certain that there exist specific genes affecting growth curves, but, due to a lack of statistical models, it is unclear how these genes cause phenotypic differentiation in growth and developmental trajectories. In this paper we present a statistical model for detecting major genes responsible for growth trajectories. This model is incorporated with pervasive logistic growth curves under the maximum likelihood framework and, thus, is expected to improve over previous models in both parameter estimation and inference. The power of this model is demonstrated by an example using forest tree data, in which evidence of major genes affecting stem growth processes is successfully detected. The implications for this model and its extensions are discussed.},

   Abstract = {To better utilize limited resources for their Survival and reproduction, all organisms undergo developmental changes in both body size and shape during ontogeny. The genetic analysis of size change with increasing age, i.e., growth, has received considerable attention in quantitative developmental genetic studies, but the genetic architecture of ontogenetic changes in bodyshape and its associated allometry have been poorly understood partly due to the lack of analytical tools. In this article, we attempt to construct a multivariate statistical framework for studying the genetic regulation of ontogenetic growth and shape. We have integrated biologically meaningful mathematical functions of growth curves and developmental allometry into the estimation process of genetic mapping aimed at identifying individual quantitative trait loci (QTL) for phenotypic variation. This model defined with high dimensions can characterize the ontogenetic patterns of genetic effects of QTL over the lifetime of an organism and assess the interplay between genetic actions/interactions and phenotypic integration. The closed forms for the residual covariance matrix and its determinant and inverse were derived to overcome the computational complexity typical of our high-dimensional model. We used a worked example to validate the utility of this model. The implications of this model for genetic research of evo-devo are discussed.},

We conducted separate analyses for varying numbers of replications, families, and plants per family using a seedling data set. Precision of re was affected by sample sizes and traits measured. To achieve a reasonable standard error and a small confidence interval of r(G), a minimum of 42 half-sib families each having nine plants in four replications would be required. Although this study was limited to seedling traits in a greenhouse, similar results may occur when measuring other traits.},

   Abstract = {This paper investigates generalized estimating equations for association parameters, which are frequently of interest in family studies, with emphasis on covariance estimation. Separate link functions are used to connect the mean, the scale, and the correlation to linear predictors involving possibly different sets of covariates, and separate estimating equations are proposed for the three sets of parameters. Simulations show that the robust 'sandwich' variance estimator and the jackknife variance estimator for the correlation parameters are generally close to the empirical variance for the sample size of 50 clusters. The results contradict Ziegler et al. and Kastner and Ziegler, where the 'sandwich' estimator obtained from the software MAREG was shown to be unsuitable for practical usage. The problem appears to arise because the MAREG variance estimator does not account for variability in estimation of the scale parameters, but may be valid with fixed scale. We also find that the formula for the approximate jackknife variance estimator in Ziegler et al. is deficient, resulting in systematic deviations from the fully iterated jackknife variance estimator. A general jackknife formula is provided and performs well in numerical studies. Data from a study on the genetics of alcoholism is used to illustrate the 'importance of reliable variance estimation in biomedical applications. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

   Abstract = {Two robust estimation procedures were applied to a random regression test-day model to reduce the effects of test-day records that are generally labelled as outliers. One robust procedure consisted of estimating residuals (actual observation minus predicted) from the genetic evaluation model, computing the standard deviation of residuals across all records, and restricting the outlier residuals to be within k standard deviations. Thus, a new observation is created for use in the genetic evaluation model. The process is part of the iterations on data to obtain solutions to mixed model equations until no more outliers beyond k standard deviations exist. Four different values of k were examined. The second robust procedure utilizes different weights with each test-day record. Weights are estimated from the residuals for all observations. Outliers tend to receive smaller weights, and thus, their influence tends to be reduced. In this study, eleven different weight formulas were compared. The objectives were to apply the robust procedures to test-day milk yield records of Canadian Jersey cattle and to determine the effects on estimated breeding values (EBVs) and rankings of animals. Results were compared to usual best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) ignoring the outlier problem.},

   Abstract = {1. Many studies recognize that growth carries with it a mortality risk that can influence an animal's growth rate. 2. Data suggest that these costs of growth act over a range of time-scales, from instantaneous to an animal's lifetime. 3. Models of adaptive growth rate have not addressed the issue of differing time-scales over which the costs of growth act. Here, we develop an adaptive growth model in which the costs of growth are delayed for a period of time, to assess optimal growth strategies in relation to delays in growth costs. 4. The optimal growth rates are calculated assuming one of two possible fitness measures: the reproductive rate, R-0 and the intrinsic population growth rate, r. 5. It is shown that if the costs of growth are felt only after maturity, then growth compensation can be an adaptive strategy, even in an unchanging environment. 6. Compensatory growth is predicted only when R-0 is the relevant fitness measure, implying that this mechanism of compensatory growth is sensitive to the processes of population regulation. 7. The effect of time-delayed costs for other life-history problems is discussed in light of these results.},

The availability of cDNA clones from these studies has facilitated the isolation of retinal and nonretinal opsin genes and cDNA clones from a large variety of species. Tod;ly, the number of genomic and cDNA clones of opsin genes isolated from different vertebrate species exceeds 100 and is increasing rapidly. The opsin gene sequences reveal the importance of the origin and differentiation of various opsins and visual pigments. To understand the molecular genetic basis of spectral tuning of visual pigments, it is essential to establish correlations between a series of the sequences of visual pigments and their lambda(max) values. The potentially important amino acid changes identified in this way have to be tested whether they are in fact responsible for the lambda(max)-shifts using site-directed mutagenesis and cultured cells. A major goal of molecular evolutionary genetics is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in functional adaptations of organisms to different environments. including the mechanisms of rile regulation of the spectral absorption. Therefore. both molecular evolutionary analyses of visual pigments and vision science have an important common goal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Abstract = {Generalized linear models have unified the approach to regression for a wide variety of discrete, continuous, and censored response variables that can be assumed to be independent across experimental units. In applications such as longitudinal studies, genetic studies of families, and survey sampling, observations may be obtained in clusters. Responses from the same cluster cannot be assumed to be independent. With linear models, correlation has been effectively modeled by assuming there are cluster-specific random effects that derive from an underlying mixing distribution. Extensions of generalized linear models to include random effects has, thus far, been hampered by the need for numerical integration to evaluate likelihoods. In this article, we cast the generalized linear random effects model in a Bayesian framework and use a Monte Carlo method, the Gibbs sampler, to overcome the current computational limitations. The resulting algorithm is flexible to easily accommodate changes in the number of random effects and in their assumed distribution when warranted. The methodology is illustrated through a simulation study and an analysis of infectious disease data.},

   Abstract = {Adult Gryllus assimilis given an analog of juvenile hormone exhibited reduced flight muscles and enlarged ovaries similar to those found in naturally occurring flightless individuals of species that are polymorphic for dispersal capability. Control and hormone-treated (flightless) G. assimilis did not differ in the amount of food consumed or assimilated on any of three diets that differed in nutrient quantity. Thus, enhanced ovarian growth of flightless individuals resulted from increased allocation of internal nutrients to reproduction (i.e., a trade-off) rather than from increased acquisition of nutrients. Compared with flight-capable controls, flightless G. assimilis also had reduced whole-organism respiration, reduced respiration of flight muscles, and reduced lipid and triglyceride (flight fuel) reserves. These differences are remarkably similar to those between naturally occurring flightless and flight-capable morphs of other Gryllus species. Results collectively suggest that the increased allocation of nutrients to ovarian growth in flightless G. assimilis and other Gryllus species results from reduced energetic costs of flight muscle maintenance and/or the biosynthesis or acquisition of lipids. Reduction in these energetic costs appears to be an important driving force in the evolution of flightlessness in insects. Respiratory metabolism associated with flight capability utilizes an increasing proportion of the energy budget of crickets as the quantity of nutrients in the diet is decreased. This leads to a magnification of greater ovarian growth of flightless versus flight-capable individuals on nutrient-poor diets.},

   Abstract = {We investigate maintenance of quantitative genetic variation at mutation-selection balance for multiple traits. The intrinsic strength of real stabilizing selection on one of these traits denoted the "target trait" and the observed strength of apparent stabilizing selection on the target trait can be quite different: the latter, which is estimable, is much smaller (i.e., implying stronger selection) than the former. Distinguishing them may enable the mutation load to be relaxed when considering multivariate stabilizing selection. It is shown that both correlations among mutational effects and among strengths of real stabilizing selection on the traits are not important unless they are high. The analysis for independent situations thus provides a good approximation to the case where mutant and stabilizing selection effects are correlated. Multivariate stabilizing selection can be regarded as a combination of stabilizing selection on the target trait and the pleiotropic direct selection on fitness that is solely due to the effects of real stabilizing selection on the hidden traits. As the overall fitness approaches a constant value as the number of traits increases, multivariate stabilizing selection can maintain abundant genetic variance only under quite weak selection. The common observations of high polygenic variance and strong stabilizing selection thus imply that if the mutation-selection balance is the true mechanism of maintenance of genetic variation, the apparent stabilizing selection cannot arise solely by real stabilizing selection simultaneously on many metric traits.},

   Abstract = {Linear mixed models are able to handle an extraordinary range of complications in regression-type analyses. Their most common use is to account for within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also the standard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However, when treated in full generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type smoothing and closely approximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models (e.g., additive models and varying coefficient models) to be handled within the mixed model framework. The key is to allow the random effects design matrix to have general structure; hence our label general design. For continuous response data, particularly when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed, computation is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS packages. Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the presence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to us supports special cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or g1mmML in R) or relies on the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of integrals (e.g., the SAS macro glimmix or g1mmPQL in R). This paper describes the fitting of general design generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference. In this generalized setting, MCMC requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In this article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS facilitates sound fitting of general design Bayesian generalized linear mixed models in practice.},

Coloration strategies in peacock feathers are very ingenious and simple: controlling the lattice constant and the number of periods in the photonic-crystal structure. Varying the lattice constant produces diversified colors. The reduction of the number of periods brings additional colors, causing mixed coloration.},
